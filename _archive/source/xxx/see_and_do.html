           <h2> Things to see and do </h2>        
<br><br>
       
<p>There are two types of days in Amsterdam, sunny, and not so sunny. For sunny days in Amsterdam, you want to be seen in one of the parks, on a man made beach, or seen simply people watching (a national past-time here) outside of jam-packed cafe or bar with an outdoor terrace. <br><br>
On rainy days the best things to do (in my opinion) are to <i>a)</i> stay at home or <i>b)</i> cry or <i>c)</i> go see a movie, visit and museum or the library; basically get cultured. F.Y.I Crying really gets you nowhere, so it isnt advisable. Once the shock of rain-intensity in this country has subsided,give it a few months, or you get some exceptional wet weather gear, rain won't be able to stop you from going to a market, getting supplies, or catching up with people outside of the rings. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger right? <br><br> Ok, so below are a few of our favourite places. <b>Legend: </b>Orange is us, Red is food and drink, Fuscia is places to visit, Dark-green is Art Supplies<br> <br>There are many, many places I have not filled in here so, feel free to look us up on foursquare.<br></p><br><br>

           <h2> When seeing and doing </h2>        
<br>
<h3>Get a <a href="https://museumkaart.nl/">Museum Card</a></h3> <br> <IMG CLASS= "TextWrapLeft" SRC="images/museum_card.svg" ALT="Museum card" style= width:90% >         
<p> This may very be by far the ugliest card in your wallet, but also one that is most value for money. Basically if you get one of these puppies, for 50 euros a year you can enter any legitimate* museum in the Netherlands (particular exhibitions might cost 5 euros extra) but entry into the museum itself is free, plus you can visit them as often as you like. <br><br>So three museum visits and it pays for itself. By legitimate* museum, I mean a public, so unfortunetely you will have to pay to see the <a href="http://www.electric-lady-land.com/">Electic Ladyland (fluroescent musuem)</a> and <a href="http://www.kattenkabinet.nl/">De Kattenkabinet a.k.a Cat museum.</a> <br><br>Get one, well worth it, plus you get to jump the tourist queues. <a href="https://museumkaart.nl/"> Buy one online</a> or ask to buy one at any museum. <br><br>
</p><br>
          <IMG CLASS= "TextWrapLeft" SRC="images/lock.svg" ALT="Museum card" style= width:90% >           <h3>Lock your bike!</h3> 
<p>Wherever you are in Amsterdam, on a busy or empty street, remember to lock your bike. 5 seconds outside Albert heijn without a lock, is seen as a bike-free-to-take here. Spare yourself the heartbreak, and sad/angry walk home. back lock and front wheel lock to something stable, a fence, tree, monument. <br><br></p>

      And of course facebook. Here there are many, many chat conversations, and events posted amoung out little group here. Be a little afraid, once you are in the group you can get bombarded with events. January was a bit brutal. Feel Free to decline or leave the conversation, it usually degenerates to sarcasm, and name calling.
