<p><h3>Dutch Design Week (DDW)</h3><br><p>Is the place to be seen, and to see contemporary Dutch design. Based in Eindhoven; both the home of Philips and Droog design this festival is mostly product, and, more recently service design based. make sure to visit the Design Academy for the Graduation show to view the narrative rich, and conceptual, alot of the products you see here are loosely practical, but very well finished. Alteratively at the Klokgebow and StrijpS you have the more commercial products.</p><br>
<h3>Museum Night/s</h3><br>Each large city in the Netherlands hosts one or two Museum Nights a year. these are a big affair where for approximately 20-25 euros all the museums in the city opens for an evening (8pm to 2am). It is usually accompanied with music, drinks and entertainment. You can see as many museums as you want, but you have to book the passin advance.<br><br>
<h3>Rolling Kitchens</h3>, 
<h3>NDSM Flea Market</h3><br>If you need to buy something obsure and on the cgeap, it should be here. That said the goods here tend to be a bit seasonal, so not much summer clothes in winter and vice-versa. You pay 3 euros to get in and then you can scavange till you heart's content.<a href="http://www.ijhallen.nl/">Find the next date</a><br><br>
