    <h4 class="recipe-section">Story</h4>
    <p>As an ode to the long-gone summer days, Manjari mixed a cocktail that had anything but tea. The cocktail was based on the famous Long Island Ice Tea, but better.</p>
    <p>It was just perfect! Why? Because, it hides the many alcohol flavors, and it tricks you into thinking you are drinking some cola.</p>
    <p>It even got Ariane drunk, which is always a good surprise.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>5 parts cola</li>
      <li>1 part gin</li>
      <li>1 part tequila</li>
      <li>1 part vodka</li>
      <li>0.5 parts triple sec</li>
      <li>0.5 parts fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>lime slice</li>
      <li>lots of ice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>Mix all the alcohol and the lime juice in a shaker. Pour it over some ice in a high ball glass. Top it off with cola and a lime slice. Stir and serve immediately.</p>

Yes, sake is actually Japanese, but we don't discriminate alcohol origins.<br> For the pear vodka, we left sliced pears in vodka for four days, though most suggest a week or two for optimal flavor. This is our first Artificial alcohol infusion and we definitely plan to do this more often. </p>

    <p>We recommend serving this drink stirred not layered to avoid the unappetizing marbling of soy cream and alcohol.</p>

    <p>Normally to pair with our delicious food we prepare Sangria but we find it quite heavy, so this year we decided to save the space for more food and replaced it with a warm and “digestive” drink.</p>

    <p>This drink was born of two desires: to have something light after a day of indulging on Thanksgiving leftovers and to light something on fire. What originally aimed to be a very autumny drink turned out to be very fruity and refreshing. This drink would be perfect for a spring or summer night on the terrace. For different variations, try lighting different herbs on fire. We found that a burning thyme shrub also worked quite nicely.</p>

    <h4 class="recipe-section">Story</h4>
    <p>Our infamous original PB&amp;J cocktail was made in the days before our digital cocktail collection existed, so we felt it was time to give it another try. We're happy to say v2 was much more successful, but we recommend straining the homemade syrup with some cheesecloth if you have some handy.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 part whiskey</li>
      <li>1 part peach-infused whiskey</li>
      <li>1 part peanut simple syrup</li>
      <li>a splash of cardamom bitters</li>
      <li>crushed peanuts for garnish</li>
      <li>orange slice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>To make the peanut simple syrup, slowly boil crushed peanuts for an hour. Strain for about 100ml of reduction, saving some for dusting. This is added to  about 800ml of simple syrup, (half white sugar, half water) and chilled.</p>
    <p>To make peach-infused whiskey, put fresh sliced peaches into whiskey and let infuse for at least a week.</p>
    <p>Pour whiskey, peach-infused whiskey, and peanut simple syrup in a shaker over ice. Use a slice of orange to wet half the rim of the glass and dust with crushed peanuts. Pour cocktail into glass and add a dash of cardamom bitters.</p>

    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 part pure vodka</li>
      <li>For the lemonade:</li>

    <p>Pour vodka into a shot glass. Don't mix with anything, and drink all at once. Be bold, as this is the only ingredient. We are no strangers to vodka flavor, but we also know that shots of pureness can be difficult, so it's nice to have something on the side. To change the taste and hydrate, always have a tall glass of lemonade on hand for when your vodka shot arrives. Mix and don't make it too sweet.</p>

    <h4 class="recipe-section">Story</h4>
    <p>Hoping to add some spiced warmth to our Friday cocktails, Manjari decided to try a garam-masala apple cider experiment. To her surprise (and that of all non-US team members) apple cider is not the same as hard cider thanks to Shannon this was quickly clarified and we did not end up with a burned garam-masala.</p>
    <p>The final result was a bit more smokey than it should have been, because we toasted the spices a bit too much and we used a scotch that was meant for sipping and not for mixing, oops! We also had to add a little more alcohol than recommended so that the flavor really came into action. In the end, the drinks were a success with our visiting clients and we all learned a valuable lesson.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 parts bourbon</li>
      <li>2 parts garam masala-spiced apple syrup</li>
      <li>1 parts single malt scotch</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>For the garam masala-spiced apple syrup, mix 30 gr of whole coriander seeds, 15 gr of whole cumin seeds, 2 cardamom pods, 10 gr of mustard seeds, 10 gr of black peppercorn, 5 gr of whole cloves, 2 cinnamon sticks and 2 bay leaves.  Toast them over low heat in a saucepan for around 1-2 minutes. In a pot, pour 440 ml of fresh apple sider and the spices, stir and bring to a boil, add 350 gr of brown sugar. Keep stirring until the cider has absorbed all the flavor. Remove from heat, strain the cider and let it cool.</p>
    <p>For the cocktails, pour the bourbon, the garam masala-spiced apple syrup and the scotch in a shaker over ice and shake well. Pour in a glass filled with ice and stir until well chilled.</p>

    <p>Every opportunity I have I try to convince people to try mezcal. Many have the idea that it tastes like tequila, and that's why they are not interested. Who does not have a bad memory (or lack of) with tequila? The big difference is that mezcal has a smoky taste and you drink it slow. Some hate it but some really fall in love with the taste.</p>
    <p>Chili is something you grow up with in México and although we do not eat as many jalapeños as people think it's what you can get here, that still gives it a spicy and rich flavor to the drink.</p>

    <p>A good chunk of our tiny office is out today, so we're making it a point to try the Parizad again in the near future! This drink is based on the classic White Russian. Proportions are vital, but the ingredients themselves can be swapped out for different variations.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 parts vodka</li>
      <li>1 part coffee liquor</li>
      <li>1 part cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>Fill a low glass with ice and add vodka and coffee liquor. Give the mixture a stir to combine the ingredients before adding the cream on top. Serve immediately to keep the layered effect.</p>

    <p>Haunted by the memory of the <a href="https://theartificial.com/cocktails/frankenmousse.html" target="blank">Franken Mousse</a>, Ariane wanted to make it up to her co-workers. She played it safe by making one of her favorite cocktails, a variation of the Americano that is said to be invented in Florence, Italy. Great way to help us warming up in this wave of cold.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 part gin</li>
      <li>1 part vermouth rosso </li>

    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>

    <p>A drink that's easier on the eyes than on the tongue. This variation on the Amber Dream makes a beautiful gradient, but unless you're a mint and absinthe fan, perhaps not our top recommendation.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 part Bols peppermint green liqueur</li>
      <li>2 parts whiskey</li>
      <li>1 part ginger ale</li>

      <li>a fresh sprig of mint</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
      <p>Put fresh mint in a tall glass with ice. Add peppermint liqueur, whiskey, ginger ale, and absinth in that order for a nice gradient. Stir with mint before drinking.</p>

We decided to make it in the middle of cold, rainy Dutch autumn to help us forget about it and pretend like it is summer for a moment. Like some say, if you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys-KP8oPdvg" target="blank">don’t complain about the weather</a>in this country you'll never truly fit in.</p>

      <li>mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>In a pitcher, mash some of the mint leaves and lime slices to make them more aromatic. Add the rest of the ingredients and stir well, top it off with some ice. Garnish with mint leaves and lime slices and serve.</p>

    <p>A simple whiskey and ginger ale, with a dash of honey chamomile bitters from my lovely Dram Apothecary bitters set. Yes, I know, mixing whiskey and ginger ale is blasphemy in the cocktail making world, but it will always have a special place in my heart (stomach).</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>1 part whiskey</li>
      <li>2 parts ginger ale</li>
      <li>a dash of honey chamomile bitters</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>Pour ingredients in a glass with ice and stir. A couple drops of honey chamomile bitters gives the drink a slightly herby taste.</p>
