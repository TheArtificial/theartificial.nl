    <p>Last Tuesday, we threw a big King’s night party to kick off King Willem-Alexander’s birthday. Of course, this means orange drinks, orange snacks, and even more orange drinks. Were we sick of the color orange? Most definitely. But that didn’t stop us from more Aperol Spritz’s today!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 parts Aperol</li>
      <li>3 parts prosecco</li>
      <li>sliced orange</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pour Aperol over a half-full glass of chilled prosecco. Garnish with some slices of fresh orange.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>A birthday drink for the birthday founder! Today we learned that it’s totally okay for your bee’s knees to be really strong as long as you’ve got <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BA2UXUEj2xt/?taken-by=shannonethomas"
    target="blank">plenty of macaroons</a> to chase it down with. For those hesitant about our ratio, we recommend ice in the glass. Gefeliciteerd!</p>
    1 part fresh lemon juice<br>
    <p>2 parts gin<br>
    1 long drizzle of honey</p><br>
    <p>Add all ingredients to a shaker and fill with ice. Shake, and strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Garnish with a lemon twist.</p>

    <p>To celebrate the recent Chinese New Year, we decided to do an Asian inspired drink. Yes, sake is actually Japanese, but we don't discriminate alcohol origins.<br> For the pear vodka, we left sliced pears in vodka for four days, though most suggest a week or two for optimal flavor. This is our first Artificial alcohol infusion and we definitely plan to do this more often. </p>
    <p>1.5 parts pear infused vodka<br>
    1 part sake<br>
    1 part lychee juice from canned lychees nuts</p><br>
    <p>Pour contents in a shaker with ice. Pour into chilled glasses and garnish with a slice of vodka soaked pear. Eating the pear is advised only for the brave.</p>

    <p>Pre-birthday party drinks at The Artificial! Perhaps starting this strong this early isn't the best idea before heading to a bar, but who can resist a great whiskey cocktail?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 part limoncello</li>
      <li>2 parts whiskey</li>
      <li>1 generous squeeze of lemon</li>
      <li>a splash of ginger beer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Combine limoncello, whiskey, lemon juice, and ice in a shaker. Shake well, then pour in a glass and top with a splash of ginger beer.</p>
