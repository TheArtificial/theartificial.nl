    <p>Last Tuesday, we threw a big King’s night party to kick off King Willem-Alexander’s birthday. Of course, this means orange drinks, orange snacks, and even more orange drinks. Were we sick of the color orange? Most definitely. But that didn’t stop us from more Aperol Spritz’s today!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 parts Aperol</li>
      <li>3 parts prosecco</li>
      <li>sliced orange</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pour Aperol over a half-full glass of chilled prosecco. Garnish with some slices of fresh orange.</p>

    <p>To celebrate the recent Chinese New Year, we decided to do an Asian inspired drink. Yes, sake is actually Japanese, but we don't discriminate alcohol origins.<br> For the pear vodka, we left sliced pears in vodka for four days, though most suggest a week or two for optimal flavor. This is our first Artificial alcohol infusion and we definitely plan to do this more often. </p>
    <p>1.5 parts pear infused vodka<br>
    1 part sake<br>
    1 part lychee juice from canned lychees nuts</p><br>
    <p>Pour contents in a shaker with ice. Pour into chilled glasses and garnish with a slice of vodka soaked pear. Eating the pear is advised only for the brave.</p>

    <p>The French Bull is a version of the French 75 that uses apriocot brandy in place of gin. Little known fact, not all French 75's are gin based! (according to my cocktail book, at least). The French of the office called bull and denounced it by equating the taste to Red Bull. And so the French Bull was born.</p>

    <p>This drink was born of two desires: to have something light after a day of indulging on Thanksgiving leftovers and to light something on fire. What originally aimed to be a very autumny drink turned out to be very fruity and refreshing. This drink would be perfect for a spring or summer night on the terrace. For different variations, try lighting different herbs on fire. We found that a burning thyme shrub also worked quite nicely.</p>
