    <h4 class="recipe-section">Story</h4>
    <p>As an ode to the long-gone summer days, Manjari mixed a cocktail that had anything but tea. The cocktail was based on the famous Long Island Ice Tea, but better.</p>
    <p>It was just perfect! Why? Because, it hides the many alcohol flavors, and it tricks you into thinking you are drinking some cola.</p>
    <p>It even got Ariane drunk, which is always a good surprise.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>5 parts cola</li>
      <li>1 part gin</li>
      <li>1 part tequila</li>
      <li>1 part vodka</li>
      <li>.5 parts triple sec</li>
      <li>.5 parts fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>lime slice</li>
      <li>lots of ice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>Mix all the alcohol and the lime juice in a shaker. Pour it over some ice in a high ball glass. Top it off with cola and a lime slice. Stir and serve immediately.</p>

    <p>To celebrate the recent Chinese New Year, we decided to do an Asian inspired drink. Yes, sake is actually Japanese, but we don't discriminate alcohol origins.<br> For the pear vodka, we left sliced pears in vodka for four days, though most suggest a week or two for optimal flavor. This is our first Artificial alcohol infusion and we definitely plan to do this more often. </p>
    <p>1.5 parts pear infused vodka<br>
    1 part sake<br>
    1 part lychee juice from canned lychees nuts</p><br>
    <p>Pour contents in a shaker with ice. Pour into chilled glasses and garnish with a slice of vodka soaked pear. Eating the pear is advised only for the brave.</p>

    <p>For us, 2017 was a great year. We welcomed many new clients with exciting new projects, and we added 3 new members to our team. Sadly we said good bye to Carol, but we are sure that she will do very well in London.</p>
    <p>To kick off 2018 we decided to mix something with some of our favorite ingredients. Sadly our experiment wasn’t what we were expecting – way too fresh for the winter, and way too spicy for some of us. We will give it another shot soon.</p>

      <li>mint</li>

    <p>For the hibiscus syrup, in a pan add 4 cups of water and a cup of dried hibiscus flower, bring to a boil, and sweeten with agave. Remove from heat and let it steep for about 15 minutes. Strain and let it cool.</p>
    <p>Mix the hibiscus syrup, vodka, and lime in a shaker with ice. In a low ball glass, add the sliced jalapeños, some ice and mint leaves, and use a lime wedge for garnish. Pour the mix in them and enjoy.</p>

    <p>Thanksgiving is approaching and it is getting colder and colder here in Amsterdam. A great excuse to mix a cocktail that you can munch on, we got to keep the calorie count high and our stomachs happy. Who would say that the pumpkin puree is so delicious, or is it the bourbon? Who cares! After drinking/eating this we all went home happy. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 parts bourbon</li>
      <li>2 parts ginger beer</li>
      <li>1 part pumpkin mixture</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To make the pumpkin pie mixture, mix the pumpkin purée, the apple juice, and some ginger, cardamum, cinnamon, and nutmeg till you are satisfied with the taste, let it cool down for a while. Then, drop a spoonful into the bottom of a glass. Pour the bourbon and the ginger beer, and top off with ice. </p>
    <p>After this experiment we definitely recommend blending the pumpkin mixture so the drink is all drink and not part of the snack. </p>

    <p>This drink was born of two desires: to have something light after a day of indulging on Thanksgiving leftovers and to light something on fire. What originally aimed to be a very autumny drink turned out to be very fruity and refreshing. This drink would be perfect for a spring or summer night on the terrace. For different variations, try lighting different herbs on fire. We found that a burning thyme shrub also worked quite nicely.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 parts orange-infused vodka</li>

    <h4 class="recipe-section">Story</h4>
    <p>Hoping to add some spiced warmth to our Friday cocktails, Manjari decided to try a garam-masala apple cider experiment. To her surprise (and that of all non-US team members) apple cider is not the same as hard cider thanks to Shannon this was quickly clarified and we did not end up with a burned garam-masala.</p>
    <p>The final result was a bit more smokey than it should have been, because we toasted the spices a bit too much and we used a scotch that was meant for sipping and not for mixing, oops! We also had to add a little more alcohol than recommended so that the flavor really came into action. In the end, the drinks were a success with our visiting clients and we all learned a valuable lesson.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>

    <p>I wanted to create something fresh yet nostalgic. Being reminded of my childhood where my friends and I sat out in the sun eating fruits and having no care in the world, drawing on the peels and giving them faces, I searched for something watermelon-y. This led me to finding this lovely cocktail, 'The Merchant's Wife', which I like to believe is based on the poem "The River-Merchant’s Wife: A Letter”, by Ezra Pound. In this poem the character looks back to the past with fond memories in a sweet and charming way.</p><p>What’s not to love?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 chunks watermelon</li>
      <li>1 part gin</li>
      <li>1 part club soda</li>
      <li>.5 parts simple syrup</li>
      <li>.5 parts Aperol </li>
      <li>.5 parts lemon juice</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Muddle the watermelon chunks and simple syrup together in a cocktail shaker. Add the remaining ingredients, fill shaker with ice, and shake vigorously. Strain over into a wine glass filled with crushed ice and serve garnished with a wedge of watermelon.</p>
