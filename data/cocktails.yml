    <p>Last Tuesday, we threw a big King’s night party to kick off King Willem-Alexander’s birthday. Of course, this means orange drinks, orange snacks, and even more orange drinks. Were we sick of the color orange? Most definitely. But that didn’t stop us from more Aperol Spritz’s today!</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 parts Aperol</li>
      <li>3 parts prosecco</li>
      <li>sliced orange</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pour Aperol over a half-full glass of chilled prosecco. Garnish with some slices of fresh orange.</p>

    <p>To celebrate the recent Chinese New Year, we decided to do an Asian inspired drink. Yes, sake is actually Japanese, but we don't discriminate alcohol origins.<br> For the pear vodka, we left sliced pears in vodka for four days, though most suggest a week or two for optimal flavor. This is our first Artificial alcohol infusion and we definitely plan to do this more often. </p>
    <p>1.5 parts pear infused vodka<br>
    1 part sake<br>
    1 part lychee juice from canned lychees nuts</p><br>
    <p>Pour contents in a shaker with ice. Pour into chilled glasses and garnish with a slice of vodka soaked pear. Eating the pear is advised only for the brave.</p>

    <p>To bid farewell to our token Dutch Artificial, we celebrated with some Nederlandse borrel en drankjes (Dutch snacks and drinks). Similar to an Aperol Spritz, this bubbly drink is typically only consumed on King's (or Queen's) Day. This is a slight twist on the traditional recipe, but just as orange all the same. Good luck to Roos on her next adventure!</p>
    <p>2 parts champagne<br>
    1 part oranje bitters<br>
    <p>Pour chilled champagne and oranje bitters into a stemmed glass. Garnish with a slice of orange and say proost to Dutch weather.</p>

      <li>For the lemonade:</li>
      <li>5 parts water</li>

      <li>a few dashes of sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pour vodka into a shot glass. Don't mix with anything, and drink all at once. Be bold, as this is the only ingredient. We are no strangers to vodka flavor, but we also know that shots of pureness can be difficult, so it's nice to have something on the side. To change the taste and hydrate, always have a tall glass of lemonade on hand for when your vodka shot arrives. Mix and don't make it too sweet.</p>

    <p>I wanted to create something fresh yet nostalgic. Being reminded of my childhood where my friends and I sat out in the sun eating fruits and having no care in the world, drawing on the peels and giving them faces, I searched for something watermelon-y. This led me to finding this lovely cocktail, 'The Merchant's Wife', which I like to believe is based on the poem "The River-Merchant’s Wife: A Letter”, by Ezra Pound. In this poem the character looks back to the past with fond memories in a sweet and charming way.</p><p>What’s not to love?</p>
