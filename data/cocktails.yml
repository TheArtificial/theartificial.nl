    <h4 class="recipe-section">Story</h4>
    <p>As an ode to the long-gone summer days, Manjari mixed a cocktail that had anything but tea. The cocktail was based on the famous Long Island Ice Tea, but better.</p>
    <p>It was just perfect! Why? Because, it hides the many alcohol flavors, and it tricks you into thinking you are drinking some cola.</p>
    <p>It even got Ariane drunk, which is always a good surprise.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>5 parts cola</li>
      <li>1 part gin</li>
      <li>1 part tequila</li>
      <li>1 part vodka</li>
      <li>0.5 parts triple sec</li>
      <li>0.5 parts fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>lime slice</li>
      <li>lots of ice</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>Mix all the alcohol and the lime juice in a shaker. Pour it over some ice in a high ball glass. Top it off with cola and a lime slice. Stir and serve immediately.</p>

    <p>Like Dude, Nathalie is a big fan of the White Russian so she decided to experiment with a fun spin off, for all of us who don’t like coffee or enjoy heavy dairy. The taste of this experiment was good but the aesthetics not so much.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 parts vodka</li>
      <li>2 parts soy cream mix</li>
      <li>1 part chocolate Baileys</li>
      <li>a cherry for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>For the soy cream mix, mix 50 ml of soy cream and 5gr of powder sugar to hide the soy taste.</p>
    <p>Fill a shaker with ice cubes, add the chocolate Baileys and the vodka and shake well. Pour it over a glass with ice and top it off with the soy cream mix over the back of a spoon to create a layered effect. Add a cherry for garnish.</p>
    <p>We recommend serving this drink stirred not layered to avoid the unappetizing marbling of soy cream and alcohol.</p>

    <p>To welcome our oral healthcare clients to our office, we created a minty concoction just for them. We intended to mix creme de menthe and peppermint schnapps with vodka, but those things were harder to find than we expected! We're glad we found Bols' Peppermint Green liqueur at the last minute, which still got the job done fine. Want to try? We hope you really, really like mint.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
    <p>1 part Bols Peppermint Green liqueur<br>
    1 part vodka<br>
    a spring of fresh mint</p><br>

We're happy to say v2 was much more successful, but we recommend straining the homemade syrup with some cheesecloth if you have some handy.</p>

    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>To make the peanut simple syrup, slowly boil crushed peanuts for an hour. Strain for about 100ml of reduction, saving some for dusting. This is added to  about 800ml of simple syrup, (half white sugar, half water) and chilled.</p>
    <p>To make peach-infused whiskey, put fresh sliced peaches into whiskey and let infuse for at least a week.</p>
    <p>Pour whiskey, peach-infused whiskey, and peanut simple syrup in a shaker over ice. Use a slice of orange to wet half the rim of the glass and dust with crushed peanuts. Pour cocktail into glass and add a dash of cardamom bitters.</p>

We are no strangers to vodka flavor, but we also know that shots of pureness can be difficult, so it's nice to have something on the side. To change the taste and hydrate, always have a tall glass of lemonade on hand for when your vodka shot arrives. Mix and don't make it too sweet.</p>

    <p>Hoping to add some spiced warmth to our Friday cocktails, Manjari decided to try a garam-masala apple cider experiment. To her surprise (and that of all non-US team members) apple cider is not the same as hard cider thanks to Shannon this was quickly clarified and we did not end up with a burned garam-masala.</p>
    <p>The final result was a bit more smokey than it should have been, because we toasted the spices a bit too much and we used a scotch that was meant for sipping and not for mixing, oops! We also had to add a little more alcohol than recommended so that the flavor really came into action. In the end, the drinks were a success with our visiting clients and we all learned a valuable lesson.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>3 parts bourbon</li>
      <li>2 parts garam masala-spiced apple syrup</li>
      <li>1 parts single malt scotch</li>

    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>For the garam masala-spiced apple syrup, mix 30 gr of whole coriander seeds, 15 gr of whole cumin seeds, 2 cardamom pods, 10 gr of mustard seeds, 10 gr of black peppercorn, 5 gr of whole cloves, 2 cinnamon sticks and 2 bay leaves.  Toast them over low heat in a saucepan for around 1-2 minutes. In a pot, pour 440 ml of fresh apple sider and the spices, stir and bring to a boil, add 350 gr of brown sugar. Keep stirring until the cider has absorbed all the flavor. Remove from heat, strain the cider and let it cool.</p>
    <p>For the cocktails, pour the bourbon, the garam masala-spiced apple syrup and the scotch in a shaker over ice and shake well. Pour in a glass filled with ice and stir until well chilled.</p>

    <p>Like the oh-so-loved-by-Dutch-doctors paracetamol, this drink was not strong enough to kill pain, nor to get us drunk. We did conclude after drinking this that everything with pineapple juice is amazing and drinkable. Next time we will try to make a variant with US, Polish, or Mexican pain killer standards, maybe then it will make for a good substitute for flu medication. </p>

Shannon and Natalia love Dark and Stormies so Natalia decided to mix it and give it a fun twist by caramelizing the limes and adding some extra ginger to it. The result was what was expected and we found out that ginger works really well as a garnish. </p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 parts ginger beer</li>

    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>To caramelize the limes, chop them in thick slices and dip them in sugar. In a pan cook both sides until they are slightly burnt and let them cool down. In a glass filled with ice, pour the ginger beer, add the lime so that is floating, and top off with dark rum to create a layer effect. Garnish with a slice of ginger.</p>

    <p>I wanted to create something fresh yet nostalgic. Being reminded of my childhood where my friends and I sat out in the sun eating fruits and having no care in the world, drawing on the peels and giving them faces, I searched for something watermelon-y. This led me to finding this lovely cocktail, 'The Merchant's Wife', which I like to believe is based on the poem "The River-Merchant’s Wife: A Letter”, by Ezra Pound. In this poem the character looks back to the past with fond memories in a sweet and charming way.</p><p>What’s not to love?</p>

    <p>Every opportunity I have I try to convince people to try mezcal. Many have the idea that it tastes like tequila, and that's why they are not interested. Who does not have a bad memory (or lack of) with tequila? The big difference is that mezcal has a smoky taste and you drink it slow. Some hate it but some really fall in love with the taste.</p>
    <p>Chili is something you grow up with in México and although we do not eat as many jalapeños as people think it's what you can get here, that still gives it a spicy and rich flavor to the drink.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1 part mezcal </li>
      <li>1 part ginger ale</li>

    <h4 class="recipe-section">Story</h4>
    <p>After several weeks of sickness and reduced alcohol tolerance, we decided to make a recipe that was a little lighter on the booze, but still full of flavor. For this recipe we lightly burned our limes, lemons, and mandarins before juicing them, giving the cocktail a subtle smoky flavor. For those of us who wanted more smoke, we used mezcal instead of tequila.</p>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Ingredients</h4>
      <ul>
      <li>2 parts tequila</li>
      <li>1 part smoked citrus juice (orange, lime, lemon)</li>
      <li>0.5 parts agave syrup</li>
      <li>club soda</li>
      <li>a sprig of rosemary</li>
      <li>cinnamon stick</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="recipe-section">Method</h4>
    <p>Cut citrus in half, dip in sugar, and cook on high heat until slightly burnt. Let cool before juicing. Mix tequila (or mezcal), smoked citrus juice, and agave together in a shaker. Add ice and shake. Pour over ice and top off with club soda. Add a sprig of rosemary and a cinnamon stick for garnish.</p>
