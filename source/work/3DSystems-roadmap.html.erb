					<h2>Mapping the future</h2>
					<p>As outsiders with access to the inside, we were able to provide a unique perspective on the future of 3D Systems. We combined our understanding of near-term product goals with strategic knowledge of the industry to create a roadmap focusing on different market approaches for disparate audiences.

					<h2>Making the useful beautiful</h2>
					<p>We could have easily sent an email or PowerPoint containing our thoughts, but such communications are easily lost in overflowing inboxes. Instead we created a long poster with illustrations, interface designs, and text descriptions.</p>
