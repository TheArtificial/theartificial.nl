					<h1>Monolith:<br/>Sparring Sessions</h1>
					<h3>When Monolith approached The Artificial, they were still at the early phases of developing their product, a tool for retailers to optimize their in-store conversion. A traditional project approach wasn't feasable, so we did a small series of sparring sessions instead.</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="padded">
					<h4>Exploring options</h4>
					<p>Monolith uses one branded visualization to summarize a retailer's performance. More than a logo or a color palette, this visualization represents their brand. We did a series of quick iterations to explore that combination of value and recognition.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="padded">
					<h4>Finding consistency</h4>
					<p>A complicated interface with multiple visualizations can easily confuse users by reusing visual techniques to mean different things. We held a workshop with Monolith to map what they wanted to say with their interface to unique and consistent methods of saying it.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="padded">
					<h4>Creating visualization guidelines</h4>
					<p>After the workshop, we captured our decisions in a series design guidelines for the in-house designers and developers to apply to the tool. Rather than focusing on concepts like color and iconography, the guidlines were based on concepts like confidence, comparison, and change.</p>
