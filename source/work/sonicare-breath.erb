					<h1>Philips Sonicare Breath</h1>
					<h3>When Philips Sonicare decided to include a breath measuring device as part of their Oral Health care system, they approached us to help create an inspiring experience.</h3>

					<h4>A challenging topic</h4>
					<p>Bad breath tends to yield unsightly visuals, especially in medical paraphernalia. The challenge was to create a metaphor that was both visually interesting and hinted at what the product was doing.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="padded">
					<h4>A fresh metaphor</h4>
					<p>We experimented in several design directions, ranging from literal to representative, and flat to dimensional, to ensure that the client had a comprehensive view of possibilities. After many iterations working closely with the client, we selected an approach that visualized the particles of breath being sucked into the measuring device. The result is a design direction that features a gentle animation of particles to mimic the activity occurring in the device.</p>

					<h4>Directing the experience</h4>
					<p>From there, we started a flow of the experience, mapping out other features such as historic data and oral health advice. We are now working on expanding and strengthening the flow, and look forward to updating with final results.</p>
