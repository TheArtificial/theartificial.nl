					<h1>TravelBird's new site vision</h1>
					<h3>TravelBird wanted to create a site that provided travel inspiration as well as travel packages. We helped to create a versatile solution that could extend to test new types of content without losing focus on the travel package deals.</h3>

					<h4>Inspiration for all platforms</h4>
					<p>We worked with TravelBird to explore a future website focused on sales through inspiration. Knowing that users explore on all platforms, we created a responsive design with a touch-first aesthetic and an interaction model based on hero experiences, cards, and progressive disclosure.</p>

				<div class="padded">
					<h4>Reducing the friction</h4>
					<p>Our friends at TravelBird know where their users have the most trouble, and we worked together to explore solutions for these areas of the user experience. Through a series of deep dives, we refined the travel package details, travel package customization, and purchase experiences. </p>
				</div>
				<div class="padded">
					<h4>Applying the vision to the near-term.</h4>
					<p>A complete redesign takes time, so we worked with TravelBird to identify where we could make big improvements with minimal effort. We designed interim solutions using the styles established in the more aspirational design to create a near-term solution for quick execution.</p>
