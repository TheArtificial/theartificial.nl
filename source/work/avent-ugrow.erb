					<h1>Philips Avent uGrow</h1>
					<h3>We worked with Philips Avent to create an app to assist parents. The platform offers a variety of connected and manual trackers, along with visualizations to help parents discern their tracked data.</h3>

					<h4>Defining a strategy</h4>
					<p>Philips wanted to create an emotional yet helpful experience appropriate to the babyâ€™s development stage. We started by helping them define their product and develop strategies around how to build and multi-faceted app that was easily navigable despite complex relationships between qualitative data, quantitative data, and advice content. Several workshops and discussions with stakeholders revealed many differing opinions and approaches, so we needed to play a key role in aligning their thinking and helping them make decisions that suited development, usability, business, and branding.</p>

					<h4>A UI to convey trust and precision</h4>
					<p>We created a design language that would appropriately show the feeling of baby, while maintaining the professional look of Philips Avent. The UI conveys trust and precision without being overly technical, and employs user uploaded content to add an emotional layer. The UI behavior and animations in technical areas bring delight and personality to the experience.</p>

					<h4>Results</h4>
					<p>We delivered over complete screens and their states, along with a comprehensive flow diagram, ui tool kit, and documentation for development. We guided the developers through the initial stages of development to ensure all content was communicated accurately. We also built a custom tool to track decisions and changes in screens to share with stakeholders so minimize miscommunication. Our documentation and deliverables were also created as a model for the future features not yet designed.</p>
