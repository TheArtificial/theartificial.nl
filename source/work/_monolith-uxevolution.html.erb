				<h3 class="turquoise-text">When Monolith approached The Artificial, they knew their product was lacking clarity, but they were unable to pinpoint the next steps in improving their product. We helped them evolve their in-store retail optimization tool into a suite of solutions that addresses their customers' specific needs.</h3>

				<h2>Understanding the user</h2>
				<p>In order to design the product in a Monolith user's brainspace, we created personas and user stories based off the knowledge we gained from our collaborative kickoff activities. This user-driven approach led to the design of a product better suited to the customerâ€™s need.</p>
				<h2>Creating clarity</h2>
				<p>How does the tool cater to those who are looking to take action and those who are looking to review data? Our answer to accommodating both was to partition Monolith into a suite of solutions, with action-led and data-led tools both feeding in and supporting each other in one coherent UI.</p>

				<h2>Keeping future development in mind</h2>
				<p>Since Monolith is planning to enhance their tool's capabilities in the future, our design intentionally leaves room for future evolutions. We delivered a UX walkthrough and design component guide as a model for future evolutions and as a tool to communicate with developers. </p>
