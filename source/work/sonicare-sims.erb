					<h1>Philips Sonicare and<br/>The Sims FreePlay</h1>
					<h3>Philips Sonicare wanted to capture new audiences by engaging them through gaming.</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="padded">
					<h4>Connecting with a character</h4>
					<p>Philips Sonicare is a brand based on science, an attribute we wanted to highlight in the lighthearted and comedic context of The Sims FreePlay. We created a character, a scientist named Max, to bridge the gap between the real world and the Sims world.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="padded">
					<h4>Motivating through gameplay</h4>
					<p>We worked with Philips Sonicare and EA to define a series of branded in-game objects and goals to introduce users to the Philips Sonicare brand.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="padded">
					<h4>Removing friction</h4>
					<p>Success meant maintaining engagment through the transition from game play to purchase. We used a combination of Sims and Philips Sonicare elements to maintain consistency as the user moved from one world to the other. While we provided a number of options for users to learn more, these were secondary to the coupon itself.</p>
