					<h3 class="dandelion-text">A London-based venture approached The Artificial with an idea for a knowledge sharing platform with a robust set of features. We worked with them to turn this long list of features into a handful of experiences that were easy for users to understand.</h3>

					<h2>Going from nothing to something</h2>
					<p>Knowing that our client had a limited budget and that the experience we designed would need customization for each organization that adopted it, we used an ambitious design approach that focused on getting a baseline design to developers as quickly as possible.</p>

					<h2>Mapping functionality to the user experience</h2>
					<p>We started by relating functionality to terminology, connecting the business case to the user experience. From here, we moved directly into a series of functional sketches to get the development track up and running before we fleshed out details like color and iconography. We then biult a series of screen templates, reusing whenever possible to reduce the development effort.</p>

					<h2>Designing for change</h2>
					<p>We took on this project just as iOS 7 had been announced. Despite having only seen Apple's screenshots, we prepared an application with a look and feel appropriate for the new operating system. With a changing foundation, thorough system documentation was paramount, and we created a set of guidelines that could easily be updated as necessary design changes were made.</p>
