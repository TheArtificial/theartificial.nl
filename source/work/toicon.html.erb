				<p class="large-body">Kata (方) is a honing exercise. Through repetition, the practice refines the basic skills necessary for mastery of a craft. We sought to better ourselves by creating sets of icons, not simply drawing things, but also exploring metaphors for visual communication. This simple exercise of exploration turned into a passion for quality and fun, a passion we thought was worth sharing.</p>
				<p class="large-body">Every icon is snapped to either a 32- or 64-pixel grid, making them perfect for digital displays. The series have traditional interface icons like save, share, and edit, as well as icons with more personality. So far, to [icon] has ten different series, with two more on the way.</p>
