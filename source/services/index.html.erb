					<p class="subtitle">To create exceptional work, we start with exceptional people.</p>
					<p class="large-body">The Artificial was founded in the hope of allowing talented, curious designers to flourish. Through the years, this orientation has produced a team that works a little differently than others, with some key benefits for our clients.</p>

					<h2 class="sub-title">Holistic</h2>
					<p class="large-body">No individual artificer has a narrowly scoped role like "visual designer" or "interaction designer". We recognize that our skills vary and collaborate accordingly while avoiding rigid roles. This keeps our perspective broad and means "how it works" and "how it feels" are both everyone's concern, so stay in harmony.</p>

					<h2 class="sub-title">Integrated</h2>
					<p class="large-body">As a boutique, we cannot pretend to bring 100% of the knowledge and skills needed for end-to-end product development. It's important that our clients and partners contribute to our work so we can learn together. Our value derives from our skills, experience, and approach, not from magic, so there is no need to hide the process.</p>
					<p class="large-body">It can be a challenge to mesh design processes with lean businesses, agile software teams, or careful scaling and risk reducing bureaucracies. We enjoy taking on these challenges to show how design can contribute to everyone's success.</p>

				<div class="padded">
					<h2 class="sub-title">Focused</h2>
					<p class="large-body">To really design a system with purpose, a level of obsession is needed. Working for only a few hours and then shifting context to another project or a meeting costs much more than time spent. We strive to keep every team member focused on one product each day, so when we are riding a bike to work we can collect our thoughts about it.</p>

					<h2 class="sub-title">Generative and Reductive</h2>
					<p class="large-body">Everybody knows that design is a process of generating new solutions, synthesizing for direction, learning, and repeating it all. "Design thinking" has become very popular to say but is rarely performed. We believe in this process at large and small scales.</p>
					<p class="large-body">It sounds simple, but means quickly generating many solutions of useful fidelity and embracing that finding the right one means "throwing away" others. Only with our holistic approach have we seen the efficiency needed to do this affordably, and it requires a broad perspective to move fearlessly forward.</p>
