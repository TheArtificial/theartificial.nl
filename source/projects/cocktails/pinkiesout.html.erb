      <p>We were recovering from two days of cold, wet windstorms, and we needed a cozy drink. Something warm, something sweet, and something with just enough alcohol to warm us from the inside out. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>1 part amaretto</li>
        <li>1 part Cointreau</li>
        <li>2 parts orange tea (we used black tea so that the hot toddy wouldnâ€™t put us right to sleep)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Brew tea according to instructions. Add amaretto and Cointreau and serve with snacks.</p>
