Apple Watch is a series of smart wearables designed by Apple to enhance the iPhone experience. Along with improving the experience of their iPhone's app, users may track their activity, measure their workouts and monitor their health. The first model, Series 1, was launched in 2015 in the US. The cabinet is available in two sizes 38 mm and 42 mm, and there is a variety of bracelet materials and colors to choose from.

  <span class="sentence">The connection process is </span>a little long but celebratory
</h2>
<p>
After choosing a language on the watch screen, the user taps 'pair' on the watch face and the watch displays a sort of ball made of particles animation that acts as a QR code to pair with an iPhone. An iOS instruction sheet pops up to tell to continue the setup from the iPhone. Tapping 'continue' on the smartphone switches to a camera mode allowing the user to scan the animation occurring on the screen of the watch. If the user places the watch displaying the animation in the field of visibility of the phone camera, pairing occurs. Thanks to this secured connection at the OS level, the app and the watch also connect. The iPhone will be able to share credential so the watch connects to the iCloud account of the user. The user is finally asked either to restore the Watch from a backup or to set up a new watch. Follows a number of screens to adjust the watch to the user preference such as choosing on which wrist to wear it, to set up a passcode, to watch a small tutorialâ€¦ etc. An alternative method for pairing exists instead of scanning the animation on the watch. It is to manually enter a 6-digit code to authenticate the watch with the iPhone.

<h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The security is </span>exemplary
</h2>
<p>
The topology shows that the Apple Watch uses a verified Bluetooth connection both at the protocol and App levels. The watch asks the user to input their password matching their Apple ID. On top of this, it is impossible to pair one watch with two iPhones at the same time. The setup would fail on one phone and process on the other phone. Furthermore, if a watch was already associated with an iPhone and is connected to iCloud via an Apple ID, it is impossible for a new user to associate with the watch. It would need to be reset to factory settings first. This prevents data leakage.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The resilience is </span>improving
</h2>
<p>
Even though some models of the Apple Watch Series 3 are equipped with a cellular 3G connection, most Apple watch models are dependent on the iPhone they are connected to. All functionalities only work when connected and in range with a phone that has an internet access.<p>
