  Apple Watch is a part of the smart wearable series designed by Apple. Along with improving the experience of iPhone apps, users may track their activity, measure their workouts, and monitor their health. We analyzed the Series 3 model with LTE connectivity.
</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The connection process is</span> a little long but celebratory
</h2>
<p>
  After prompting the user to select a language, a new Watch immediately broadcasts a pairing request. Because it is a priviledged member of the iOS system, a nearby iPhone will pop up an instruction screen guiding the user to continue the setup from the iPhone. As the user progresses, the Watch displays a particle animation and the iPhone switches to a camera mode allowing the user to scan this animation (as with a QR code). When this optical recognition verifies the Watch, it is paired.
</p><p>
  An alternative method of manually entering a 6-digit code to verify pairing is also available.
</p><p>
  The iPhone shares the user's iCloud credentials so the Watch can connect directly. The user is then asked either to restore the Watch from a backup or to set up a new watch. What follows is a number of screens to adjust the watch to the user's preferences.
</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The security is</span> exemplary
</h2>
<p>
  The Apple Watch uses a verified Bluetooth protocol connection and also authenticates at the software layer. The iCloud registration adds even another layer of protection, and the one-to-one pairing model means even if hijacking became possible it would be quickly noticed by the user. Even with full physical access, using someone else's Watch requires a full reset, preventing leakage of personal data.
</p><p>
  The inner workings of watchOS and iOS and the Secure Enclave features of modern Apple processors are beyond the scope of this analysis, but they appear to be best of class.
</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The resilience is</span> complicated
</h2>
<p>
  This is a product with many functions, many of which do not require a connection at all or deal gracefully with unreliable connections while others might depend on the iPhone in ways not clear to the user. There are other UX problems around media services, such as the storage location or streaming flow of music.
</p><p>
  Generally, though, the inclusion of both Wi-Fi and LTE to augment the Watch's reliance on the iPhone mean the user experiences a highly connection-resiliant device. The use of iCloud Keychain so the Watch can securely learn how to connect directly to known Wi-Fi networks is helpful.
