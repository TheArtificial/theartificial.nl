<p>
Beasts of balance is a colorful game produced by Sensible Object in which several players stack as many creatures and shapes as possible on a connected physical game board. While each artifact is stacked on top of each other to form a tower, an animated world is building up on the connected device. This makes it a hybrid game.

  <span class="sentence">The connection process is </span>quick and easy
</h2>
<p>
The only thing the user has to do to connect the board of the game is to download the app on a device and to turn on the base of the board game by pressing the power button. A red led indicator turns on to inform that the game is ready to connect. The app instantaneously detects the base and walks the user through a welcome tour.

<h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The security is </span>appropriate
</h2>
<p>
The connection flow is quick and not really secured, but this is appropriate for a product that doesnâ€™t hold sensitive data. Indeed, the OS does not ask for permission to pair, nor does it confirm that the user is pairing the right game platform, leading to an unverified Bluetooth connection at the protocol layer and at the software layer.
</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The resilience is </span>okay
</h2>
<p>
If the device and the game stay in Bluetooth range, meaning less than 9 meters apart, the game functions as it is supposed to.
