<p>
Beasts of balance is an interactive game produced by Sensible Object in which several players stack as many creatures and artifacts as possible on a connected physical game board. It can be played with a connection to a smartphone, tablet or TV. It is a hybrid game - flowing between digital and physical play. The aim of the game is to build a tower with the creatures and artifacts on the connected platform which does not fall. The twist is that as you build, the creatures being stacked are animated on the app and influence the users decision on which artifact should be added next.

  <span class="sentence">The connection process is </span>quick and easy
</h2>
<p>
The only thing the user has to do to connect the board of the game is to download the app on a device and to turn on the base of the board game by pressing the power button. A red led indicator turns on to inform that the game is ready to connect. The app instantaneously detects the base and walks the user through a welcome tour.

<!-- <h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The security is </span>appropriate
</h2>
<p>
The connection flow is quick and not really secured, but this is appropriate for a product that doesnâ€™t hold sensitive data. Indeed, the OS does not ask for permission to pair, nor does it confirm that the user is pairing the right game platform, leading to an unverified Bluetooth connection at the protocol layer and at the software layer.

<h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The resilience is </span>okay
</h2>
<p>
If the device and the game stay in Bluetooth range, meaning less than 9 meters apart, the game functions as it is supposed to.
