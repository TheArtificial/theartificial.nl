Cube+ is a splash-resistant and shockproof cubic camera launched by Polaroid in 2015. Unlike the former Polaroid Cube, Cube+ connects via ad hoc Wi-Fi. It has a wide-angle lens and HD video. Its battery last about an hour and a half. Photos and videos are stored in a micro SD card. The Cube+ can be mounted on a stand or a helmet, or clipped thanks to a pendant case. It functions in pair with the Polaroid Cube+ app.

  <span class="sentence">The connection process is </span>clear
</h2>
<p>
The Polaroid Cube+ connects to the Polaroid app, which is available for both iOS and Android users. The app walks the user through a guided tour, giving highlights on how to connect the camera to the app. There are two buttons on the camera, one to switch the camera on and off as well as for capturing photos and videos, and the other to initiate ad hoc Wi-Fi broadcasting. The user needs to switch on the camera, and then press and hold the Wi-Fi button, for the camera to broadcast its network. The app instructs the user to connect via their phone’s Wi-Fi settings. Once the Cube+ is connected to the ad hoc network, the user needs to navigate back to the Polaroid app, where they have to confirm the connection on the smartphone screen. Success. The camera is all set and the camera viewfinder is visible from the app.

<!-- <h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The security is </span>low
</h2>
<p>
Even though the ad hoc network powered by the camera uses a password to establish a verified connection with a device, ad hoc connections in general, suffer from having less security against unwanted incoming connections compared to a secure Wi-Fi infrastructure connection. If a hacker gets within the signal range of the camera, there is little difficulty to connect to its ad-hoc. Another issue that is not directly linked to connectivity is that if the camera is stolen, the thief would have access to all the media stored in the camera.
</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The resilience is </span>okay
</h2>
<p>
The camera and the device need to be in close proximity to each other for the connection to work well. Without Wi-Fi, the users cannot turn their smartphones or tablets into Cube+ viewfinder. On second use from the same smartphone, the OS settings should remember the password of the ad hoc Wi-Fi generated by the Cube+ so the user does not have to re-enter it. Media are stored in the MicroSD card up to 32GB. When we tested it, looking at photos and videos stored on the Cube+ from the Polaroid app can be a little slow to load.
