Electric S is a connected electric bike launched by the Dutch company VanMoof in 2007. Aside from the great power boost button on the bike that assists with pedaling, the bike has several notable features, such as the smart lock. The smart lock can be unlocked from a remote or from a smartphone via the VanMoof app.

</h2>
<p>
To connect the bike for the first time, the bike has to be charged, the smartphone needs to have an internet connection, and the VanMoof app should be installed. The user creates an account and then registers their bike thanks to the IMEI and frame number. These two unique numbers associate the bike to a particular user. If the email confirmation is approved, the user can log into their VanMoof account. Once logged into the app, the bike automatically connects to the app when in Bluetooth range. If auto-lock is activated, the user has a few seconds to unlock the bike chain before it locks again.

  <span class="sentence">The security is </span>unusual but strong
</h2>
<p>
The topology of connections is atypical. Here, the VanMoof account of the user plays an important role in the security as it is holding the unique identifying numbers of the bike. The account is protected by a password. Only one phone at a time can be connected to the bike. This is a secured practice because the user would need to log out before another phone logs in with the account that is associated with the bike. The bike connects with the VanMoof account, but also pairs and connects to the device’s OS. The connection at the OS level is unverified, but because of the bike registration with the account, the connection from the bike to the account is verified. The user can also decide if they want to activate the auto-unlock functionality. If so they can adjust the range of unlocking. Unlocking is possible from the bike display, from the app, and from a remote.  A great service that VanMoof offers is a bike hunter who will track down the user bike if it ever gets stolen. This isn’t in anyway associated with our connection flow, but we think its a pretty nifty service offering.

  <span class="sentence">The resilience is </span>terrible
</h2>
<p>
A few of the previous bike releases have been victims of software bugs that killed their power assist functionality or drained the bike’s battery. Another big issue in earlier models is that the smart lock requires electrical power to lock and unlock the bike. The only solution, to make the bike and the lock to work again, is to reset the bike with a Mini USB service port. Luckily, VanMoof worked on fixing the issues with their newer models and replaced the bike lock with an alarm. Aside from this bug, the Bluetooth connectivity works fine when the bike and the app are in range. Regarding data, such as parking location or rides details, they are synced with the app when in Bluetooth range. VanMoof also uses a GPS tracking system when the bike is reported stolen, so hopefully, they can retrieve a signal from the bike.
