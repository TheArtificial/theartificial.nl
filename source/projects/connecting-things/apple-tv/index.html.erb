  <span class="sentence">The connection process is </span>a little long
</h2>
<p>
First things first, the black box of the Apple TV has to be plugged into power. Then it can be connected to the internet using an Ethernet cable, or Wi-Fi. In a third time, Apple TV should be plugged into a television via HDMI. The Apple TV setup screen should then appear on the television display. After choosing a language, the Apple TV can be configured using an iPhone or another Apple device. Using a spare device for the setup simplifies the transfer of settings from the iOS device to the Apple TV, including login information for Apple products and Wi-Fi credentials.

  <span class="sentence">The security is </span>reassuring
</h2>
<p>
Any connection using a physical cable feels more secure because there is no room for mistaking a connected product with another product. The iOS device facilitating the setup of the TV is using a verified Bluetooth connection both at the protocol and at the software layers. Because both the Apple TV and the iOS device are connected to the same verified Wi-Fi network, they can exchange information securely. Plus Apple tracks the product and the device proximity.

<h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The resilience is </span>okay
</h2>
<p>
To set up the Apple TV with another iOS device, the two items should be extremely close to each other. Otherwise, the Apple TV wonâ€™t detect the device supposed to help to set it up. Once set up, the TV function either with Wi-Fi or with Ethernet that makes a backup solution if one or the other connection is not working.
