<p>
Kindle Voyage is an E-reader marketed by Amazon and released in 2014 in the US. It is equipped to wirelessly connect. Some new generations readers are 3G enabled. The screen uses electronic ink and adaptive light sensor to adjust brightness to provide a comfortable reading experience. The e-reader allows reading, storing e-books, newspapers, magazines and other content but also buying new content.

<p>
Connecting a Kindle is fairly straightforward thanks to the display of the product itself, as opposed to some other products needing to be configured from another device. From the settings of the Kindle, the user must first connect to a wireless Wi-Fi network. Then, from the same settings menu, the user has to log in or create an Amazon account. logging in automatically registers the Kindle to the user’s Amazon account.

<!-- <h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The security is </span>okay
</h2>
<p>
When the home Wi-Fi network is protected by a password, the connection is more secured. An Amazon account is also protected by a password. As the Kindle is not protected by a password, anyone could grab the user’s e-reader and start reading without their permission. De-registering a Kindle is possible from the Kindle, a mobile, a computer, or any other device.

</h2>
<p>
Without an access to a Wi-Fi network nor to 3G, no more content can be purchased directly from the Kindle or synced from the cloud. However, all items previously purchased or downloaded are accessible offline. The airplane mode preserves battery by preventing the Kindle to connect to the internet. Kindle remembers several Wi-Fi passwords. Kindle automatically connects to a previous network when in range. If more than one network is in range, Kindle connects to the last one used.
