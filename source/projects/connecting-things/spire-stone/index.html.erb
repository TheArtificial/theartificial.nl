Stone is a wearable tracker that monitors breathing patterns in order to help reduce stress. The accessory was launched in 2014 by Spire. It detects moments of calm, tension, focus, and activity. The stone vibrates when it senses an abnormality in a user's breathing patterns, which might be brought on by stress or tension. Shaped like a grey pebble, it is made of foam and has a metallic clip. It is designed to be clipped on to a waistband of pants or skirts, or to a bra - anyplace where it can be in contact with the user's skin. The stone connects via Bluetooth to the Spire app, which collects and displays the user’s health data. The stone is sold with a charging pad and a USB cable.

<p>
There are no buttons on the Stone, and hence, when charged, it is always broadcasting Bluetooth. The user needs to create, or log in an account on the Spire app to begin the connection process. The user initiates the discovery of a new Stone from the app. If Stones are found, the app asks the user to select their Spire from a list. Once the user selects, the stone vibrates to indicate the app is requesting to pair. The app asks the user to confirm that the right stone vibrated, and then pairs with the Spire Stone. That’s it, the user can already observe their breathing movements on the app.

<p>
Pairing the device is verified because the user identifies their stone once it vibrates. The vibration confirms that the app did not detect another Spire Stone nearby. Spire Stone can only be connected to one phone at a time. Data is protected by the fact that the Stone would need to be unpaired from a phone first before being able to pair to a new device.

<p>
The Stone connects to the app via Bluetooth, as long as the Stone and the device is within 9 meters of range. The phone needs an internet connection for the app to be connected the account. The Stone itself stores up to 6 hours of the user's most recent data, which it uploads to the device when it is connected and in range. Notifications on the Stone and the app only work when they are in range. The Stone also works with the app installed on a tablet supporting Bluetooth 4.0.
