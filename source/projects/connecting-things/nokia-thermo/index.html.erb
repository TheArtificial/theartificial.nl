Nokia Thermo measures temperature from the user’s forehead and automatically syncs readings with the dedicated app via Bluetooth. Thermo is also equipped with a LED display that gives readings directly on the object. It measures temperature from the blood circulating in the temporal artery thanks to 16 infrared sensors. A color-coded indicator informs the user if the temperature taken is normal, elevated, or high while taking into consideration the age of the patient. The object is white, has a LED screen, one button, and one green and soft part to apply on the forehead. Thermo app allows logging comments, medications, and photos. These pieces of data can easily be shared with a doctor. All members of the family can create their own profile. It was launched in 2016 by Withings that has been bought over by Nokia.

  <span class="sentence">The connection process is </span>clear
</h2>
<p>
To connect to Nokia Thermo, the user needs to download the Nokia Thermo app and to log in. The Thermo app walks the user through the setup. The user puts the Thermo in setup mode by pressing and holding the button on the Thermo until the LEDs display ‘SETUP’. At a point, an OS overlay pops up to reveals the thermometer discovered by Bluetooth. Once the user taps on the item in the list of available product, the app connects to the Thermo. The app proceeds to ask the user to connect to a Wi-Fi network. If the user selects a home Wi-Fi that the device is already connected to, the setup is quicker as the home Wi-Fi password can be shared from the device. The app is busy again with an indeterminate progress indicator displaying that the app is configuring, and activating the thermometer. To finish, the app shows a small tour that teaches the user how to scan the forehead for a reading.

<!-- <h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The security is </span>okay
</h2>
<p>
Thermo’s OS and software connections are both verified thanks to a physical button on the device and by a password protected Wi-Fi connection. Thermo registers to the user account through the home Wi-Fi. Thermo registers to the user's Nokia account via Wi-fi. This practice is secured but hacking the Thermo or the data is still possible.

<h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The resilience is </span>good
</h2>
<p>
Thermo only needs to be connected to a phone for setup and data syncing, and not for continued use. Thermo uses Wi-Fi or Bluetooth to sync the user data with the Thermo app when in range. In fact, during the setup, if the user does not have access to a Wi-Fi network, they can use Bluetooth to configure the device instead. The configuration of the Thermo should be updated in case the Wi-Fi network has had a change in name or password, or the user would like to use a different network, or, if the user would like to switch from a Bluetooth configuration to a Wi-Fi configuration.
