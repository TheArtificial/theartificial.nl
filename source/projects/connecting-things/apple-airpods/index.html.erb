AirPods are cord-free Bluetooth earbuds. They come with a charging case. They were released in 2016 and designed by Apple. Audio plays as soon as a user places the AirPods in their ears and stops when the user removes them thanks to an accelerometer. AirPods allow listening to audio content, changing songs, making calls, talking to Siri or get directions.

Apple came up with this ‘One-tap’ setup for all Apple devices. On the first use, when the user pulls the AirPods out of the charging case, they instantly turn on and instructions for pairing appear on the nearest Apple device such as an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. The user has to press and hold the button on the charging case in order to pair. Then, the user sees their AirPods and charging case battery levels, pressing ‘Done’ on the device indicates that the connection is successful. Nothing more is required to enjoy the AirPods. This connecting experience is an inspiration for all complex and non-user friendly flows.

Once set-up, the AirPods connect to the user’s Apple ID and therefore to any other devices on the same iCloud account. iCloud accounts are protected by a password. In case the AirPods get lost, Find my iPhone can help the user locate a missing earplug. If someone is trying to connect to another user’s AirPods. An OS overlay informs that these are “Not your AirPods”. The new user is still able to establish a connection to use them.

The connection is flawless. The earphones are working within a range of up to 50 meters. So a user could easily use them at home while their phone is charging. The only problem is that Siri requires an internet connection. If the user double taps on the earphones to talk to Siri and that there is no access, it becomes useless. The AirPods's battery counts about 24-hour listening time and up to 11 hours talk time. The ultimate test for these earbuds connection would be an entire plane of AirPods users, using their earbuds while flying. Would this work as well?
