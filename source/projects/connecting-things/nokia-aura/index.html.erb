Aura is a 25-cm tall alarm clock and a bedside lamp launched in 2014. It was designed by Withings that has been bought over by Nokia. The Aura clock comes with an additional sensor that sits under the mattress to track sleep. Both accessories connect to the home Wi-Fi. The purpose of this clock is to help users waking up and falling asleep smoothly. Users interact with Aura with quite novel gestures, like swiping on the right side of the device to adjust light or volume and pressing the side of the alarm for 2 seconds to stop the alarm. The clock is configured with Nokia Health app.

  <span class="sentence">The connection process is </span>easy but long
</h2>
<p>
To start, the user needs to download the Nokia App, to create and account or log in, and to connect Aura to a power supply. As Nokia app groups various connected products, the user can choose which product to install. The app automatically starts searching for the Aura. When found, it appears in an OS overlay in the Nokia app. The user selects the Withings Aura from the list, and the next screen shows that the Aura is paired. Then, the app asks to choose a Wi-Fi network. If the smartphone is already connected to a Wi-Fi network  and if the permission is granted by the user, finishing the setup is simpler because the device gives Wi-Fi credentials to Aura. After showing an indeterminate progress indicator, the app asks if the user would like to install an Aura sleep sensor. At last, a product tour explains gestures to control Aura and some UI shows that the connected alarm clock is set.

<!-- <h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The security is </span>worrying
</h2>
<p>
Aura has unverified connections to the phone OS and to the Nokia app. The pairing process is not verified because the user is not precisely identifying their alarm. During the pairing process, the device could pair to another alarm without the user noticing it. In the Android flow, it is interesting to notice that an OS alert asks the user to enter a pairing code, but that no pairing code is given… Aura registers to the user's Nokia account via Wi-fi. This practice is secured but privacy does not seem to be taken too seriously when a user doesn’t get informed that someone else connected to the user's Aura and had access to their sleeping related data. It is even more worrying knowing that any guests surfing on the home network could potentially access these personal data.</p>

<h2 class="subtitle">
  <span class="sentence">The resilience is </span>okay
</h2>
<p>
The Aura just requires a phone for the setup but once the home Wi-Fi is connected, the clock functions as a standalone device. Some bugs are reported since Nokia took over Withings. Some functionalities also went missing like luminosity, noise, and temperature for the Aura. Without a Wi-Fi connection, some functionalities stop working. To change Wi-Fi network, a quick configuration exists in the app settings.
