</h2>
<p>
To connect the camera to a smartphone, the user first needs to download the OI.Share app. The user has to find out where to activate the Wi-Fi from the Olympus camera without directions. The functionality is called ‘Connection to Smartphone’ and it lives in the ‘Playback’ menu. This option has the camera to start a Wi-Fi ad hoc connection, and to display of the password of this network along with a QR code. With an Android device, the user just requires to scan the QR code from OI.Share app ‘Easy setup’. If the smartphone is running on iOS, the app requires the user to install a profile to connect. A button opens up an external site. After tedious taps here and taps there to install the profile in the device settings. The user has to navigate back to the OI.Share app to read more instructions on how to connect. Instructions at a point inform the user to navigate back to the OS setting and to pick the camera ad hoc network from the Wi-Fi available networks. Once selected, the password provided by the camera should be entered in the device. In the app, an icon shows that the camera is successfully connected.

  <span class="sentence">The security is </span>low
</h2>
<p>
Even if the ad hoc network powered by the camera uses a password that makes it a verified connection, ad hoc connections suffer from having less security against unwanted incoming connections than a Wi-Fi infrastructure connection. If a hacker get within the signal range of the camera, there will be little difficulty to connect to its as hoc.

If the camera and the device stay close to each other, the connection is stable.
