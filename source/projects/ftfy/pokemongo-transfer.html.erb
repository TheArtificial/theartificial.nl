           <p>After accidentally transferring my brand new, beautiful Venomoth,  and then seeing that I was not alone, I knew this would be a perfect FTFY  example.</p>
           <p>Overall Pokémon Go is a beautifully designed game. And like most beautifully-designed things, this only makes the flaws stand out more. </p>
           <p>Enough talk, let’s fix this thing.</p>

         <h2>After</h2>
         <p>The most frustrating aspect of the accidental-transfer-button is that it wasn’t a problem in the beginning. The transfer button was at the bottom of the Pokémon’s card. It wasn’t in a FAB (floating action button) with it’s opposing action – favorite.</p>
         <p>In my story, it’s the “favorite” that threw me. On the Pokémon overview screen, the FAB also has “favorite” – only here it serves as a sort rather than an action. I had sorted by favorite and I wanted to sort by something else. I was in autopilot as I sorted by the only other thing in the list.</p>
         <p>This brings me to another point. This game has so many confirmation overlays, and whether you’re confirming positive or negative, they’re the same!</p>
         <p>So here’s the fix.</p>
         <p>We all know hamburgers are terrible. We all know FABs are terrible. Get rid of this frankenstein fabburger and bring back the button. Make the user scroll to transfer. Create a nice big touch target. This solves the lesser problem of accidentally evolving the thing you mean to transfer because your left thumb can’t reach all the way to the fabburger.</p>
         <p>And then, embrace red. Negative actions like transfering a pokemon should not appear the same as positive actions like leveling up and evolving. Interrupt the user’s autopilot.</p>
