			<h1>Redesigning WatchOS</h1>
			<p class="authors">an experiment by <%= link_to_person 'shannon' %> and <%= link_to_person 'ariane' %></p>
			<p>The Apple Watch is a beautiful and powerful piece of hardware accompanied by incredibly useful software. It replaces a handful of other wearables byÂ tracking steps, heartrate, standing, and more. It empowers users to handle notifications without digging through their bags (or pockets) to find their phones. It provides information at multiple resolutions with complications and apps (and formerly glances). Appropriately limited in its functionality, the Apple Watch still provides users with the ability to get directions, check the weather, send quick replies to messages, set tea timers, check into a location, and meditate with haptic guidance.</p>
			<p>WatchOS 3 brought some changes to the familiar interface. Most notably, Glances and Friends were removed and Dock was introduced. WatchOS 3 also made it possible to switch between multiple watch faces. The interaction of multiple watch faces (and complications) is the subject of this redesign.</p>
			<h2>Beautiful alone, imperfect together</h2>
			<p>There is no doubt that Apple Watch faces are <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/04/apple-watch-design/">beautifully designed</a>. The details of each face are painstakingly considered and executed with the utmost care; however, with the introduction of multiple watch faces in the new WatchOS, it is obvious that the watch faces were designed to be perfect when standing alone, but not when viewed with others.</p>
			<p>Looking first at the digital faces, the time itself jumps a few pixels up and then a few more back down when switching between Photo, Motion, Astronomy, and Activity watch faces. Only the Activity watch face offers the long-format time (in a notably non-standard version of SF Compact), while only the Photo and Photo Album faces allow the user to switch the time between top and bottom layouts.</p>

			<p>The analog faces have somewhat more consistency, but still the ring of numbers bounces up and down while the allowed complications vary (somewhat unpredictably) per watch face. In addition, the Chronograph and and Activity watch faces have unique inner elements; Color offers a monogram option; and Simple, Utility, and Chronograph allow for the date within the face (Activity requires it).</p>

			<h2>Unifying the Grid</h2>
			<p>At a glance, the different watch faces have more in common than not. The digital faces all have the time in large type positioned with the baseline about 33% from the top of the screen. We started here, and then created variations across faces for top and bottom text placement and consistent complication arrangement. In the case of Activity, we found that by treating the activity visualization as a complication, the layout could be created with the Modular watch face.</p>

			<p>Getting the analog watch faces on the same grid was simple compared to the digital faces. Here, however, we took on the additional challenge of making the Activity and Chronograph features into complications that could be used across all faces. We also made the monogram and date complications shared across all faces.</p>

			<p>To avoid locking a user in a world of either digital or analog, we synchronized the two grids. Ten rows of 39px or 34px (depending on screen size) create a vertical rhythm across faces, with the complications fitting nicely into the corners across all. Now the user wanting the date always in the top left can do so across all faces without any format changes or jumps.</p>
