To celebrate all of your support for our first Kickstarter,&nbsp;[to&nbsp;[icon]](http://toicon.com/). READMORE we've decided to share with you some of the techniques behind the icons. In this case the all demanding Isometric icon. The goal of this tutorial is to introduce you to the basics of isometric sketching in CC Illustrator.
By the end of the tutorial you should:
1. Know some fundamentals about Isometric drawing
2. Be able to set up an isomeric grid on art boards
3. Be able to make any kick ass isometric cube
4. Be a able to extrude and cutaway details 

# Know Thy Axis
If you didn't know already, to really get into the Isometric sketching you will have to deal with the X, Y and Z axis. Anything you draw in an isometric view will not really have a front face or bottom face; being tilted and at 60 degrees angles, whatever you choose to sketch wil have two sides visible in addition to the top side. Even if the object is hollow or has no top you may even be 4-5 sides to create, so keep that in mind.

# 1. Some Prep
Just for my own peace of mind. Regular hygiene. Start a new layer, label it guides.

# 2. Make the Z lines
Make your z axis first. Draw a line, and using transform, align it to a full pixel value on the x and y.
Now with a simple alt+Shift+D you can drag to duplicate it. Once you have your first copy you can CMD+D to repeat that until you get as many verticals as you want/ need to cover your artboard.
Keep it clean, so Group them, CRL or CMD-G.

Tip: If you want to align your lines further to a specific value after that, say 20px select all of your z axis lines and in the Align panel select align to selection, click on the first line you made, and enter “20px” in Distribute spacing. To set it, hit the horizontal distribute button.

# 3. Make the Y lines
Duplicate your freshly made Z lines. Copy, paste basically. 
Rotate them 60 degrees, and, adjust the length to cover the artboard.
These will be your y-axis guides. I’ve trimmed these, but you can leave them as they are.

# 4. Make the X lines
Duplicate your Y axis lines. Copy and paste these in place CMD+Shift+V.
they should be still selected, then go to Transform > Reflect > Horizontal.
These will be your x-axis guides. I’ve trimmed these, but you can leave them as they are.
You may have to  re-align them ( Shift move up or down) to make the proper Isometric box pattern.

Tip: If you want to apply these to multiple artboards like I did Copy and Paste on all artboards (CMD+ Shift+Alt +V).

# 5. Convert to Guides
Ready? Select all your lines, and go to View > Guides > Make Guides. 
Your lines should go Cyan., and officially be guides.
Now if you press CMD+; , those guys should toggle on/off. 
Now you can start building things.

I use them mostly for extruding, and double checking my alignment.
But if you have aligned your original lines,  with a bit of luck with snap to grid and snap to point on, you can sketch straight on top. Double check that your spacing between the guides and your grid match.

# 6. Sketching
As I mentioned before anything you will draw in an isometric view, will have a left, right and top view or side. So you will have to design all three sides, if not more.

I tend to make these all at the same time. Making sure the heights and widths line up. I usually start with the left view (my front) and then duplicate that and resize to make sure everything lines up.

Then I squish, skew and spin all of the sides to make them isometric. Take a look at the examples.

Open Question to the crowd- I have tried to make these into Actions in Illustrator,  but they only work if all or your heights, depths and  widths are consistently the same.  The actions don’t seem to like re-calculating percentages on case-by-case basis, meaning it messed everything up pretty fast if you have a range of sizes. I think its the percentage that throws it off. Has anyone got a work around for this?

# 6. Adding Depth (a.k.a making it sexy)
Adding depth is unfortunately a bit hit and miss at the beginning. But a bit of practice goes a long way.

My technique is copy and paste in place (CMD+Shift+V) or parts I want to extrude. Then you move the copied object forward or back using the 60 degree angle guides you made. Then using Pathfinder to Boolean ‘unite’ or ‘minus front’  you can add protrusion or cutaway hole.

Have a look at the video for how I deal with cylinders and round amorphous shapes.
