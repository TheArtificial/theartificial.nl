It's important to know your goals with prototyping in order to determine which tool best caters to your needs. Prototypes can be used for rapidly iterating on information structures, demonstrating concepts and functionalities, or conveying the product's animations. Some tools may handle one requisite brilliantly, but lack the functionality to accomplish your targeted goal efficiently.

We compared eight prototyping tools to help guide you to the appropriate tool for your specific challenge.

## Prototyping tools
We chose these seven tools because they show a range of qualities and methods.   

[**InVision**](www.invisionapp.com)|||| A web-based collaborative program / iOS & Android    
[**Pixate**](http://www.pixate.com/)||||  Google's native mobile prototyping tool / iOS & Android  
[**Principle**](www.principleformac.com)||||  Created by a former Apple engineer / iOS  
[**Form**](www.relativewave.com/form/)||||  Google's patch-based prototyping tool / iOS & Android    
[**Origami**](https://facebook.github.io/origami/)||||  Facebook's Quartz Composer plugin / iOS  
[**Framer**](framerjs.com)||||  JavaScript based prototyping / iOS & Android   
[**Xcode**](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)||||   Development tool by Apple Developer / iOS


There are four types of prototyping tools: Visual layer-based, Visual page-based, Patch-based, and Code-based. Some tools use more than one of these construction concepts, but it's important to make a distinction between these categories. 

Visual layer-based tools layer multiple assets and screens on one canvas. The user can drag elements around and interactions and animations are tied to each layer. Visual page-based tools are very similar, but have separate screens rather than one layered canvas. In patch-based tools, patches which can contain assets, groups, interactions, and more, are configured and plugged into each other. Lastly, there are code-based tools. These can range from code that emulates your final product, to code that can be turned into your final product.

## A need to iterate quickly 

##### Workflow and Interface

Being able to iterate quickly means having an interface that has common functions readily available. Having a way to quickly import assets doesn't hurt either. I found that visual page-based tools were best suited for this. It is ideal for helping solidify or negate information structure decisions early on.

In programs such as **InVision** and **Principle**, hotspots and arrows allow you to tell the tool what should come when something is tapped. This also means a lot of time saved cutting tappable assets, since screens can be imported directly. **InVision** also has the benefit of team collaboration. Your colleagues can comment or edit your prototype directly and it will update in real-time. 

**Pixate** is a visual layer-based tool, so does not use a page linking system. However, you can still create hotspots with clear layers that produce an animation on tap.

**Framer** also provides ways to help iterate quickly. They have a built-in paging snippet, and if you use Sketch or Photoshop to design your screens, Framer saves you a lot of hassle in setting up your assets. An easy import function contains all the properties in one line of code. **Origami's** asset handling is also notable here. You can link your Sketch assets and they can be updated without rebuilding anything. However, like **Form**, the patch-based interface means that to test information architecture, you would need several patches and layer groups, which gets messier a lot quicker than the visual page-based tools. **Xcode** also links assets, but writing that much code to test possible solutions might not be efficient.

## A need for user testing

##### Flow Exploration

Prototypes are great for user testing, but in order for your user to accurately understand your product's concept, the user must be able to navigate through an adequate number of screens. This is when user exploration is key. How extensive of a flow does the tool allow for, and is the user able to interact with it in the same way she would with the final product?

None of the tools reviewed place limits on the number of screens, but some become unmanageable after a certain point. For instance, **InVision** keeps all your screens separate, but too many screens means a very slow loading interface. **Pixate**, being entirely layer-based, is very difficult to manage multiple screens in. I think of **Pixate** as trying to orchestrate a play; elements are all stacked on top of each other, both on and off the stage, and the designer tells each piece what to do and when to do it. Tools such as **Principle**, **Xcode**, **Form**, **Framer** and **Origami** are better for handling long flows. These will still lead to a lot of clutter on your screen, so your biggest obstacle is your patience level. If your prototype needs to include multi-touch gestures, then you will need to use either **Xcode**, **Form**, or **Origami**.

###The Artificial's pick: Principle for single-touch prototypes. Xcode for multi-touch prototypes.


## A need to communicate desired animations 

##### Transitions and Animations

Most prototypes found online demonstrate fancy unique animations. If this is your aim, you'll want a tool that gives you flexibility and high fidelity in effects.

**Pixate** and **Principle** allow you do achieve this with ease. **Principle** is very reminiscent of Adobe After Effects, so for those familiar with that program, the logic of timelines is familiar. However, when comparing it side by side to **Pixate**, I found that Pixate's effects mimicked native apps more accurately. **Origami** and **Form** also allow for deep exploration in effects. While they have patches specifically made for common effects, it requires a few other patch connections to get working. **Framer** and **Xcode** similarly have code snippets for ease of use, but require more code to get higher fidelity. **Invision** simply falls short in comparison. Many effects were unachievable and the tool requires the use of GIFs for simple things such as blurring.[Download all Transitions and Animations GIFs for comparison.](https://www.theartificial.nl)
