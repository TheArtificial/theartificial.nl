When I began my career as a designer, I thought about designing stuff. I worried about things like typography, transitions, and usability. Then, through several promotions and starting my own company, I began thinking less about designing stuff and more about designing teams.

In many ways, designing stuff and designing teams is similar. Both need strong compositions, both require harmony amongst the individual elements, and both require careful attention to the details. With both stuff and teams, it’s important to observe when parts are working and when parts aren’t; however, when you’re designing stuff, it’s relatively easy to throw away a part that’s not working.

Just over a month ago, I chose to dismiss one of our team. This single event, which lasted not even an hour, was possibly the most difficult thing I’ve done in my career. And while it feels pretty crummy to give up on somebody, I also believe it’s one of the most important things I’ve done for my own growth as well as for the growth of The Artificial.

While hiring is something we’re happy to talk about openly, firing is something that managers usually discuss behind closed doors and over drinks. It’s not something we readily share with non-managers, except to say that it’s happened, often sugar-coating the reasons why.

But like all failures, I see a failed hire as an opportunity to learn. It’s important not only to reflect, but also to reflect openly and honestly so that others can understand and possibly even learn from the experience.

# Good Diversity and Bad Diversity

We strive to create a diverse team in background as well as in passion, which often means hiring people without traditional UX or UI backgrounds. Usually, we’ll seek common ground, looking for portfolios that show an orientation to the details, a passion for visual design, and an ability to express process through writing. While this has served us well in team-building, it’s also created an environment where we all prefer working to talking. This is what we were hoping to shake up.

So we reached beyond our common ground and hired someone who we thought would push us all to be more active with users and in the community. We knew that integration would be a challenge, but it was one that we were excited to take on because we believed it would make us better.

What I realize now is that hiring someone who’s different only works if that person has a compatible process with everyone else on the team. A team that enjoys organization, focus, and written communication is going to suffer at the hands of somebody who has a chaotic and external process.

Having learned the difference between good diversity and bad diversity, we decided to add a [design test](http://theartificial.nl/blog/2017/04/11/design-test.html) to our hiring process. This test looks beyond basic design skills to understand a person's process, ensuring that those we hire can create and communicate with everyone else on the team, even if their passions are wildly different.

# Proof Over Promises

We tend to hire people who don’t have a lot of experience. We look for passion and a foundational understanding and then invest in training to build good habits and deep expertise. Even without a portfolio flush with relevant work, it’s easy to see when a product or graphic designer takes pride in what they make.

But somebody whose value is in working with users and connecting with the community doesn’t necessarily present via a traditional portfolio, and so we took the pitch we received in the interview as a promise.

In retrospect, I never should have hired someone who didn’t have a track record of doing what they claimed. I mistook a lack of success for a lack of opportunity and an inability to weave a story around their experience for an insufficient education. It was my own hubris that led me to believe that I was uniquely positioned to provide an environment that would lead them to share our passion and to develop their own.

# Attention Is a Valuable Resource

It’s easy to over-invest in problem employees at the cost of those who are committed and successful, after all, in order to be a productive contributor, an employee who’s struggling _needs_ more attention than one who isn't.

I spent nearly six months fully committed to teaching one lagging employee everything I could. We spent time collaborating; I demonstrated how I would approach different design problems; and we even iterated on their process. I rarely went a night or weekend without working as I struggled not only to teach but also to backfill on the project they weren’t able to productively contribute to.

While it may seem that the victim here was my free time, it was something far more important – my ability to give time to other Artificial employees. While our team is four people, 80% of my time was going to the weakest member. My attention was so consumed, I only had time to react to problems and never to proactively prepare the team for what was coming. Even worse, I found myself pushing others to fill my shoes often without the support they needed.

It’s a common interview question to ask: _What’s your biggest weakness?_ Hands down, mine is that I’m terrible at giving up on people. More than once, I've spent months investing more than I could afford while ignoring my own exhaustion because I needed to prove that I could teach anyone to be an Artificial designer.

And in the end, the decision to give up one someone is always one that I obsess over. When faced with a team member who just isn't working, I can't go an hour without bringing it up and I am constantly distracted by the weight of it. But once the decision is made, it all seems so obvious, and I don’t know how I didn’t see it sooner. It’s clear now that creating a safe and challenging environment at The Artificial means staying focused on the overall composition rather than obsessing over any single element that just doesn’t fit.
