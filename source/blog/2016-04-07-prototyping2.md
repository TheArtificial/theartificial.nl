As Paul Gubbay, vice president of Creative Cloud product management at Adobe, puts it (1) “Designers have been waiting for the right UX tool to simplify app and web experience design.” As we mentioned in [**Selecting the optimal prototyping tool (part 1)**](http://theartificial.nl/blog/2015/11/23/prototyping.html), when it comes to prototyping, there is not (yet) one right tool, that unanimously reaches designers’ hearts. Indeed each prototyping tool was born in a peculiar environment and developed with a specific angle. Before picking a tool, you should determine your prototyping goals. You might not set your mind on the same tool depending on if you are trying to clarify an interaction model or if you are focusing on presenting the product's animation.

We were beta testers for Adobe Experience Design CC (Preview) and we contributed to their feedback forum. The software aims to create and share interactive prototypes. We were expecting the public release to implement some of testers' requests. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. We feel it still needs to reach the same level of intricacy that other Adobe software have. We are hoping that the new experience design tool will soon integrate with Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop to facilitate workflow. While Adobe is seeking for input from the creative community to make the product evolve, we felt it was a good time to get a closer look at a second set of prototyping tools.


## Prototyping tools

We compared seven more tools to help guide you to the appropriate tool for your specific challenge.

[**In Part 1**](http://theartificial.nl/blog/2015/11/23/prototyping.html), we discerned four types of tools: Layer-based, Page-based, Patch-based, and Code-based. It is helpful to have a general idea of what to expect from these interfaces, even if their construction concepts can be mixed together. The trend among the above set of prototyping tools is mainly Page-based interfaces with hints of layers, patches and code.

## Interaction overview

If the prototyping tool is smoothly handling iterations, intuitively managing assets and lets you easily collaborate with your team, it will probably save you a lot of time.

![Workflow and Interface](2016-04-07-prototyping2/interaction.gif)

##### Linking screens

The tools reviewed are all mainly Page-based with the exception of **Hype**, which relies on a more Layer-based interface.

**Figma (Preview)** has not implemented interactive prototyping functionalities. If you are looking to create interactions and animations, it is not the right tool for you. We hope they plan on adding interactive functionalities.

In all other tools, you can connect individual elements to each other to build interactions. **Axure** and **Justinmind** are very powerful for building specific interactions thanks to elaborate condition settings. They are both data-driven prototyping tools that use variables.

**Axure** has the major disadvantage of not having a layer panel. Stacks of animated layers, called dynamic panels, may give you a serious headache to select and to organise, especially if you did not meticulously name your elements.

**Proto.io** uses both pages and states to help you keep your project organised.

In **Flinto** and **Adobe XD (Preview)**, to define links and transitions, you drag wires between screens. Those visual connections are an easy way to create a mental image of a short app flow but more complex products may look messy and confusing if lots of interactions are added to the screens. We found that prototyping with **Adobe XD (Preview)** has very little benefit for now because of the limited interactions available. For instance, when prototyping a short [**Huddle**](http://theartificial.nl/huddle/) sequence, the single interaction we were able to perform is switching between screens.

##### Asset handling

Building a prototype raises assets related questions. Would you like to be able to draw your prototype elements from scratch within the tool or would you rather import your designs from an external software? How often are your assets recurring in your sequence?

On one hand, if you are interested in drawing your elements within the tool, you should consider **Justinmind**, **Proto.io**, **Adobe XD (Preview)** and, above all **Figma (Preview)**. **Figma (Preview)**, a browser-based editor, surprised us with its fast and smooth vector handling. Indeed, it brings a new vision of how drawing and editing paths can be achieved more naturally.

On the other hand, if you are used to creating your screens with other software, such as Adobe Illustrator or Sketch, you should have a closer look at **Proto.io**. The tool's seamless drag-and-drop-feature will easily help you import assets. If you are a Sketch addict, **Flinto** is for you. It lets you re-import your Sketch source file and your changes will update automatically! Hooray. Unfortunately for Adobe Illustrator users, there is no such functionality and the copy and paste option results in pixelated images. So you'd better finalize your assets before importing.

**Justinmind** is the only tool that updates asset links automatically, saving you a lot of time.

**Axure**, **Figma (Preview)**, **Justinmind**, and **Proto.io** and have really handy ready-to-use resources for generic designs such as iOS or Android UI mobile elements.


##### Assisting with collaboration

Building and improving your prototype requires sharing work, collecting feedback and collaborating with your team.

To test your prototype, most tools generate a url link that you can share. **Axure** uses a cloud hosting solution called AxShare, but it gives you slow and flickering prototypes. Tools like **Justinmind**, **Flinto**, **Hype**, **Proto.io** and **Axure** have a free mobile viewer app. You should just keep in mind that some prototypes' viewer apps give smoother results than other. **Justinmind's** one is glitchy and inconsistent with the desktop preview.

In **Figma** and **Proto.io**, users that have access to the project are able to add comments and create discussion threads to provide feedback. Some tools are going further by letting you work directly with your team on the same prototype. It is the case of **Axure** and **Justinmind**. **Justinmind** has another special feature of guidelines generation with Microsoft word and it supports html5 exports like **Hype**.

## Aesthetic detail

Aesthetics details are important to help effectively communicate with developers or stakeholders. Your app has a unique feeling and you want to convey it through flowing animations, polished effects and faithful adaptation across several devices and gestures. The tool should help you achieve building your prototype and it should not constraint your design too much.

![Transitions and Animations](2016-04-07-prototyping2/aesthetic.gif)

##### Animating

In **Figma (Preview)** and **Adobe XD (Preview)**, animations are respectively non-existent and almost non-existent for now, so there is very little to talk about regarding aesthetics details.

On the contrary, some other tools let you simply build animations and transitions. Well, **Axure**, **Proto.io** and **Flinto** animations feel native and you are able to customise or create your own effects. For more experienced users, in **Axure** you can build effects by injecting code. In **Proto.io**, too many animations going on at once can be messy and in **Flinto** some animations cannot occur simultaneously… bummer! But fortunately **Flinto** has other values. It lets you chose a name for your custom transition and re-use them in your prototype for consistency. It is very convenient if you’d like the same fancy animation to occur several time in the app.

As explained above in Interaction overview, **Justinmind** is powerful for building your navigation, but it is not your champion for animations.

##### Adjusting the feel

When you reach the point of satisfaction with your prototype but you noticed a slight bothering detail, you feel grateful if the tool allows you to make your tweak without sweating it out and breaking what’s in place. Fortunately, the creators of the seven tools implemented some functionalities to help you adjust the feel.

**Flinto** shows you curves representing speed and distance to ease the feel of an action, just like in Adobe After Effects.

**Hype** makes tiny changes tiresome because you have to adjust the timeline and figure out if that adjustment affects later animations.

In **Proto.io**, it is quite difficult to find the right component to edit. Many animations are stacked on each other and can’t be combined so each movement must be labeled explicitly. Moreover, your workflow is slowed down because saving and loading your changes take time, especially if you want to see results on a device.

**Axure**'s interface is text heavy and options are hidden in submenus that do not make it very easy to find the options you are looking for. Luckily, **Axure**'s community has resources to share.

##### Handling different sizes and gestures

You would like your design to smoothly translate from a mobile, to a tablet, to a desktop… but today, most of the tools around constrain you to a single screen size. Some tools implemented some parameters to let you incorporate a bit of flexibility. **Axure** has an adaptive view setting and **Hype** uses responsive layouts where you can specify breakpoints. **Proto.io** also supports changing orientations and allows fluid project duplication across devices. In **Justinmind** you can add conditions with window width for resizing. **Figma (Preview)** was again surprisingly smooth to use when handling adaptability. It uses constraints, layout grids, frames and even nested frames that are able to scale. We found the Figma's solutions promising, so we hope their team is working toward supporting interactions.

What is the point of putting effort into learning a prototyping tool if the prototype is not interactive? Otherwise you could just use a video editor such as After Effects for more effects possibilities. Instead you want users to be able to test it out, to feel it, to break it, to spot the incoherences, to enjoy the hero moments and to acknowledge swelling sequences. Unfortunately, in **Hype**, basic interactions such as scrolling can only be simulated with an animation. Contrary to **Axure**, **Atomic**, **Flinto**, **Hype**, **Proto.io**, and **Adobe XD (Preview)**, which only propose a set of simple gestures, **Justinmind** incorporates some multi-touch gestures like pinch and rotate.

## Making a decision

To put in a nutshell, as mentioned in [Part 1 of this article](http://theartificial.nl/blog/2015/11/23/prototyping.html), we avoided categorising those seven prototyping tools with a binary vision of  “good vs. bad” or “easy vs. difficult” because they all have strengths that could satisfy different designers' primary objectives for specific projects. This post intended to broaden the scope and draw you a more global image of the tools' capabilities. We hope you have a better idea of which tools you want to play with.
