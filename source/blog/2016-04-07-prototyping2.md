As Paul Gubbay, vice president of Creative Cloud product management at Adobe, puts it (1) “Designers have been waiting for the right UX tool to simplify app and web experience design.” As we mentioned [**in the first part of the post**](http://theartificial.nl/blog/2015/11/23/prototyping.html), when it comes to prototyping, there is not (yet) one right tool, that unanimously reached designers’ heart because each prototyping tool was born in a peculiar environment and developed with a specific angle. Before picking a tool, you should determine your prototyping goals. You may not set your mind on the same tool if you are trying to clarify an interaction model, to demonstrate concepts and functionalities or to present the product’s animation.

In March 2016, Adobe finally announced the availability of Adobe Experience Design CC (Preview). Previously called Comet, the software, renamed Adobe XD aims to create and share interactive prototypes. We are disappointed by this public release, because we feel it still requires to mature to reach the level of the giant Adobe other pieces of software in the Suite. We are hoping that the new experience design tool would soon integrate with Photoshop CC and Illustrator CC to facilitate workflow. While Adobe is seeking for inputs from the creative community to make the product evolve, we found the timing is right to get a closer look at a second set of other prototyping tools.


## Prototyping tools

We compared seven more tools to help guide you to the appropriate tool for your specific challenge.

[**In Part 1**](http://theartificial.nl/blog/2015/11/23/prototyping.html), we discerned four types of tools: Layer-based, Page-based, Patch-based, and Code-based. It is helpful to have a big idea of what to expect from those interface, even if their constructions concepts can be mixed together. The trend among the above set of prototyping tools is mainly visual page-based interfaces with hints of layers, patches and code.

## Interaction overview

If the prototyping tool is smoothly handling iterations, intuitively managing assets and letting you easily collaborate with your team, it would most probably make you save a lot of time building your prototypes, testing your interactions models and flows.

![Workflow and Interface](2016-04-07-prototyping2/interaction.gif)

##### Linking screens

The tools reviewed are all mainly page-based except **Hype** that is relying on a layer-based interface with a timeline like video editing software such as Adobe After Effects.

**Figma (Preview)** did not implement the functionality of linking two screens but they seemed to have set their focus on issues concerning designers such as drawing assets and creating responsive layouts. We will talk about those later but if you are looking to create interactions and animations, it is not the right tool for you. We hope they plan on building screens sequence.

In all other tools, you can connect individual elements to each others to build a flow. **Axure** and **Proto.io** are very powerful for building a flow thanks to elaborated conditions settings. They are both data-driven prototypes using variables. If you are familiar with Adobe products and its floating windows and palettes, you might quickly get in hand **Justinmind**, whereas if you are a crack with Microsoft office Suite (90’s series), **Axure** may seem faster to learn thanks to a similar interface with a top toolbar and the same left-panelled page hierarchy than Power Point. In fact, the analogy makes sense when you know that **Axure**'s two founders Victor Su and Martin Smith first started to build softwares from PowerPoint, Visio, and Word documents.

Aside from connecting independent assets, **Axure** also allows you to create links thanks to hotspots. However it has the major disadvantage of not having a layer panel. Stacks of animated layers, called dynamic panels, with their possible different states, may give you a serious headache to select and to organise, especially if you did not meticulously name your elements.

**Proto.io** differentiates itself by using both pages and states to help you keep your project organised.

**Flinto** and **Adobe XD (Preview)** are also using a page-based structure, but to define links and transitions, you drag wires between screens. Those visual connexions are an easy way to create a mental image of a short app flow but more complex products may look messy and confusing if lots of features are added to each screens. We found that prototyping with **Adobe XD (Preview)** has very little benefit for now because of the limited interactions available. For instance, in the short sequence of [**Huddle app**](http://theartificial.nl/huddle/) we tried to prototype, the single available interaction among the ones we wanted to perform is an easing between screens. We hope for future developments to include basic functions such as scrolling and overlays.

##### Asset handling

Building a prototype raises assets related questions. Would you like to be able to draw your prototypes elements from scratch within the tool? Would you rather import your designs from an external software? How often are your assets recurring in your sequence?

On the one hand, if you are interested in drawing your elements within the tool, you should consider **Justinmind**, **Proto.io**, **Adobe XD (Preview)** and, above all **Figma (Preview)**. **Figma (Preview)** browser-based editor surprised us with its fast and smooth vectors handling. Indeed, it even goes further by bringing new visions of how drawing and editing paths can be achieved more naturally. **Figma (Preview)** is build on ‘vector networks' which offer lots of flexibility and control. You can edit paths with new ways of splitting and recombining. Path bending also becomes easier with two possible manipulation: control handles, familiar to adobe user, or direct drag on the curve.

On the other hand, if you are used to create your screens from other software such as Adobe Illustrator and Sketch and you are wishing to import existing designs to build your prototype, you should know that you can import images on any of those tools, but you can have a closer look at **Proto.io**. **Proto.io**’s seamless drag and drop will easily help you importing assets. The other plus is a library assisting you managing multiples.
If you are a Sketch addict, **Flinto** is for you. It is letting you re-import your Sketch source file and your changes will update automatically! Hooray. Unfortunately for Adobe Illustrator users, there is no such functionality and the copy and paste option results in pixelised images. So you better cut and exports your assets before importing them individually.
Aside from importing cut assets, **Axure**’s hotspots are another way to create links and they can save you some precious time. Rather than spending time preparing individual assets, you can just create actionable zone on your image. This solution is convenient if you are wishing to have something to share in a short amount of time.

Justinimind is the only tool handling asset linking. We believe this functionality can save you a lot of time by syncing your changes from your working files instead of making you manually update assets each time you modify them.

**Axure**, **Figma (Preview)**, **Justinmind**, and **Proto.io** and have really handy ready-to-use resources of widgets for generic designs such as iOS or Android UI mobile elements.


##### Assisting with collaboration

Building and improving your prototype require sharing work, collecting feedbacks and comments and collaborating with your team.

To share test the website / app you are building, most tools like **Adobe XD (Preview)** generate an url link that you can share with your stakeholders. It is the case of **Axure** and its AxShare, a cloud hosting solution, giving you slow and flicky prototypes. **Justinmind** sharing works the same way but viewing your prototype on you online account is less glitchy and inconsistent than on their app on your device. Most apps like **Justinmind**, **Flinto**, **Hype**, **Proto.io** and **Axure** have free mobile viewer apps.

In FIgma’s Feedback mode and in **Proto.io** users that have access to the project are able to add comments and create discussion threads to provide feedback. Some tools are going further than just being able to comment by letting you work directly with your team on the same prototype. It is the case of **Axure** that makes sure all users have the latest version of the prototype and **Justinmind** with a system of committing changes and updates. **Justinmind** has another special feature of guidelines generation with Microsoft word and it supports html5 exports like **Hype**.

### The Artificial's pick for a Interaction overview prototypes: **Flinto** and Justinimind.

## Aesthetic detail

Aesthetics details matters to effectively communicate with developers or other stakeholders. Your app has a unique touch and you want to convey it through flowing animations, polished effects and faithful adaptation across several devices and gestures. The tool should let you pleasingly achieve your prototype and it should not guide your design.

![Transitions and Animations](2016-04-07-prototyping2/aesthetic.gif)

##### Animating

In **Figma (Preview)** and **Adobe XD (Preview)** animations are respectively non-existent and almost non-existent for now so there is very few to talk about regarding aesthetics details.

At the contrary, some other tools let you simply build animations and transitions. Indeed **Axure**, **Proto.io** and **Flinto** animations feel native and you are able to customise or create your own effects. For more experienced users, in **Axure** you can build effects by injecting code. In **Proto.io**, too many animations going on at once can be messy and in **Flinto** some animations cannot occur simultaneously … bummer! By chance **Flinto** has other values. It let you chose a name for your custom transition and re-use them in your demonstrator for consistency. It is very convenient if you’d like the same fancy animation to occur several time in the app.

As explained above in Interaction overview, **Justinmind** is powerful for building your navigation, but it is not your champion for animations.

##### Adjusting the feel

When you reach the point of satisfaction with your prototype but you noticed a slight bothering detail, you feel grateful if the tool allows to make your tweak without sweating it out and breaking what’s in place. By chance those seven tools creators implemented some functionalities to help you adjusting the feel.

**Flinto** shows you curves of speed and distance to ease the feel of an action just like in Adobe After Effects.

**Hype** makes tiny changes tiresome because you have to adjust the timeline and figure out if that adjustment affects later animations.

In **Proto.io** it is quite difficult to find the right component to edit. Many animations are stacked on each other and can’t be combined so each movement must be labeled explicitly. Moreover, your workflow is slowed down because saving and loading your changes are taking time, especially if you want to see results on a device.

**Axure** interface is text heavy and options are hidden in submenus that does not make it very easy to adjust the prototype. By chance, **Axure** community has resources to share and is helping you. **Axure** and **Justinmind** provide guides, global masters and templates.

##### Handling different sizes and gestures

You would like your design to smoothly translates from a mobile, to a tablet, to a desktop… but today, most of the tools around constrain you to a single screen size. **Flinto** for instance, does not handle adaptive layouts. Other tools incremented some parameters to let you incorporate a bit of flexibility in your prototype. **Axure** has an adaptive view setting and **Hype** uses responsive layouts where you can specify breakpoints. **Proto.io** also supports changing of orientations and allows fluid project duplication across another device. In **Justinmind** you can add conditions with window width for resizing. Most of those functionalities build for adaptivity are combined in **Figma (Preview)** that again is surprisingly smooth. It uses constraints, layout grids, frames and even nested frames that are able to scale. The logic of those scalable frames is similar to a <div> in html. We found the solutions Figma are proposing promising so we hope they are working toward supporting interactions.

What is the point of placing efforts to learn to master a prototyping tool if the deliverable you are building is not interactive? Otherwise you would use a video editor such as After Effects for more effects possibilities… instead you want users to be able to test it out, to tap, to swipe, to flick, to scroll, to pinch and spread; you want them to feel it, to break it, to spot the incoherences, to enjoy the hero moments and to acknowledge swelling sequences. Unfortunately, in **Hype**, basic interactions such as scrolling can only be simulated with an animation. Contrary to **Flinto** and **Axure** that only propose a set of simple gestures, **Justinmind** incorporates some multiple fingers gestures like pinch and rotate.

## Making a decision

To put in a nutshell, as mentioned in [Part 1 of this article](http://theartificial.nl/blog/2015/11/23/prototyping.html), we avoided categorising those seven prototyping tools with a binary vision of  “good vs. bad” or “easy vs. difficult” because they all have strengths that could satisfy different designers primary objectives for specific projects. This post intended to to draw you a global image of the tools capabilities over a more complete range of tools comparison. We hope you have a better idea of which tools you want to play with.
