## 8 by 8
8 by 8 is a New York based football publication started by the partners from design company Priest+Grace. (Fun fact, it’s called 8 by 8 because the goalposts are 8feet high by 8 yards long) The designers aim to make the magazine “as visually dazzling as the game itself” in order to stand out from the countless other publications featuring the World Cup. To achieve this, they implemented action packed illustrations in order to incorporate commentary and satire into the works of art. These stunningly detailed spreads fill the publication with enough excitement and depth to do justice to the thrilling sport.

## The World’s Ball
The football itself has gone through many changes since the first World Cup. It began as inconsistent hand-sewn leather balls that had to be laced and inflated with great skill and care.
