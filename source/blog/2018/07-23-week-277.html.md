Everyone seems to know already â€” this is our last week.

This Friday is the last day of normal office operations and over the last month many Artificers have already dispersed. I will soon begin my first in-house job while Shannon will continue offering strategic design and creative services as a freelancer.

Naturally, everyone asks "why?" There's no single precipitating event or cause, but to simplify: Shannon and I considered the paths of small agencies and decided we would seek to join a larger network in 2018. Halfway into the year, we noticed our options all entailed business-as-usual for ourselves, would take years to develop, or required compromising our values.

So the time has come to wrap up this 5-year project. We've learned a lot, created unique opportunities for many, and can remember it as a success!
