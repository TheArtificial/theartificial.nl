Everyone seems to know already â€” this is our last week.

Shannon will continue offering strategic design and creative services as freelance projects. In that way the agency is [rebooting](https://artificial.design/) rather than ending, but Friday is the last day of normal office operations. Over the last month many Artificers have already dispersed, and I will soon begin my first in-house job.

Naturally, everyone asks "why?" There's no single precipitating event or cause, but to simplify: Shannon and I considered the paths of small agencies and decided we would seek to join a larger network in 2018. Halfway into the year, we noticed our options all entailed business-as-usual for ourselves, would take years to develop, or required compromising our values.

So the time has come to wrap up this 5-year project. We've learned a lot, created unique opportunities for many, did some amazing work, and will remember it as a success!

If you'd like to keep up on our future adventures, [follow us individually](/people/).
