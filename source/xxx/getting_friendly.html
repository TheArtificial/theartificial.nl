<h2>Making friends</h2>        
<p></p>
<p>Being an expat in Amsterdam, you are definately not alone. Over 50.5% of the residents of Amsterdam are not  from the Netherlands originally. So you have quite a community to tap into. <br><br>
We are quite a strange bunch however, there is a certain type of person who ends up far away from home, in one shape or form chasing a dream.</p>

<br>
<h2>Make use of housemates</h2> 
<p> They are valuable assets. As fun as we are here, you dont want to be hanging out with us all the time. So feel free to take advantage of your housemates. Cook a meal together, go out for a drink, or tag along for an event.</p>          <br>
           <center> <IMG SRC="images/hello.svg" ALT="hello my name is" style=" padding-top:1em;  width:100%;" ></center><br>
<h2>Go to a Meetup</h2><br>
This is a bit more of a formal one, but some of the groups can be fun. Being a startup-digital hub, Amsterdam has many work and networking events. But <h ref="http://www.meetup.com/find/?keywords=amsterdam&radius=5&userFreeform=Amsterdam%2C+Netherlands&mcName=Amsterdam%2C+NL&lat=52.350006&lon=4.9167023&sort=default">The Meetup platform</h>also has groups interested in fashion illustration, beer, cheese and acrobatics. So take a look. There's nothing to lose really.<br><br>

<h2>Sign up for a class</h2><br>
           Sometimes it getting out of the house (or shoebox) that is important. There are many after-work classes and activities happening in and around Amsterdam. It really depends what you are interested in.<br>

<h2>Keeping in touch</h2>        
<br><h3>Skype, What's Ap... and alternatives</h3>
<p>Invest in your mental health and stay connected. The most difficult bit about living in a clashing time-zone to your loved ones is aranging a time to catch up with them. Someone is always waking up or going to sleep, if you happen to be an Australian in Europe <br><br> Scheduling a time, even loosely is the best way to chase away the expat blues. Feeling alone, and missing people is quite alright. Make it an adventure, dry looking at each other, can get be akward, especially at first.  Why not try a romantic dinner via skype, cooking the same meal on both sides to share transcontinentally? watching a shitty movie together 1990's style? Play online <a href = "http://wwww.http://www.isketch.net/"> Pictionary</a>(and cheating) against the room. Or even more excitingly invite a friend to do a guest appearance at a party. <br><br> It's important to stay in each other's lives even if for 5 spectacular minutes once a while.</p>

       <h2>and... Dutch people</h2>        
<br>

<p>Its a bit tough to break into the dutch social scene here, particularily if your dutch is "niet so goed".<br><br>
Although Dutch culture is very western, there are a few fascinating nuances that can catch you off guard.<br><br><i> <h3>3 Kisses for hello</h3></i><br> New dutch acquaintances should be greeted with a handshake. As for longer-term friends, a 3-point kiss - that’s cheek-to-cheek-to-cheek, is commonplace. When leaving a Dutch home, always part with a dag (day), or shout a more informal doei (bye). Hug/cuddle at your own peril.<br>
<br><i> <h3>The Dutch agenda</h3></i><br>
Unlike free-spirited expats, the Dutch are known to have agendas are booked up weeks in advance, cross-referenced and committed to memory as back-up. This might strike the spontaneous folks as odd, but there is a definate 'appointment' culture here. Don't get too upset if someone can't see you for a few weeks cause they are booked up.<br>
<br><i> <h3>Directness</h3></i><br>
The Dutch have earned themselves a reputation for being incurably outspoken. Speech is almost always context-driven and without hyperbole. This naked style of conversation has its positive sides in that you can ask a Dutch person anything, and sure enough you’ll get the answer.<br>

<br><i> <h3>Euro, euro bills 'yall</h3></i><br>
No-one loves a bargain quite like the Dutch. That’s why window shopping takes many forms: if you want to keep it real, look for damaged goods and labels promising sale (uitverkoop); special offer (aanbieding or aktie); offer (reclame); and the most exciting of all, everything must go (alles moet weg). If you say gratis (free), you’ve just made a Dutchie very very happy. They are very thrifty folk. keep that in mind for outings.<br>

<br><i> <h3>Did you know...?</h3></i><br>
The Dutch hold knowledge in high regard, and many love nothing more than a long evening of heated political discussion. They also have an uncanny ability to call upon seemingly trivial trivia at the drop of a hat. How to gain the advantage here? It's simple: either keep up-to-date with the workings of the world, or, bring along some obscure facts of your own.<br><br>
