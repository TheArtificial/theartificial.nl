<h2> Welcome</h2>        
<br><br>
<p>Well, first of all welcome to Amsterdam and The Artificial! We are glad that you could make it. What is this? I hear you ask, well, is teeny-tiny guide to Amsterdam, that you can use to get by as you get settled in. Hopefully it can answer some questions you might have about how to have a great time not only in the office but also out of it. We want you to enjoy Amsterdam as much as we do during your stay.
<br><br>
As with anything we make here, this is just a small conversation starter, feel free to talk to any one of us humans about anything Amsterdam related. Combined we should be able to answer most things, and if not at least know where to start looking.</p>
