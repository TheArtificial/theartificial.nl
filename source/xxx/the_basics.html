<h2> Getting Started</h2>        
<p></p>
<p>Day to day life in Amsterdam is fairly relaxed in comparison to other major cities. Below are a few things to get you started. A rough guide to transport, shopping, and housing.</p>

<h2>Getting Around</h2> 
<br>    <center><IMG SRC="images/transport.svg" ALT="Conexxion bus, GV ferry and tram" style= "width:100%; background-color:#fffff"></center>
<h2> Public Transport</h2>

<p> For your first days the best way to get around is either walking or public transport. Here the busses, trains and trams are faily punctual, clean and safe. The only real deterent to them is that in many cases you could cycle there quicker. Here all public transport is linked to the OV Chipcard system, you can get one of these at most train stations, post offices, and some news agencies. You can either purchase a disposable one or a anonymous plastic one that you can then top up and reuse. 
    <br> 
    <br> 
    Prices for public transport are calulated by distance and time, but its about 2.00 for a tram or bus ride around Amsterdam. If you have a dutch bank account and a residence, then you can apply for your public transport 'korting'/ savings card, which for a cheap 50 euro a year gives you 40% discount on offpeak travel on trains ( which is great for exploring the Netherlands on Weekends). All the ferries are free, so a great way to explore the north.</p><br>

<h2> Bikes </h2>
<p>If you are going to stay in Amsterdam, or the Netherlands in general, you are going to need a bicycle. The bike culture here is so strong there are 881,000 bicycles in a city of 799,000 residents. There are many options around for bike rental or, if you are here for a while, you should seriously consider purchasing one for yourself. </p><br>
<h4>Rental</h4>
<p>One of your aims in renting a bike in Amsterdam is to get an 'normaal'looking bike. That means not fluroescent, shiny and brand new. Although brightly coloured bikes are easy to find in a bike stand, they also make you stand out on the road, and, bear the wrath of tourist-averse Amsterdammers. If you have an OV Chipcard (public transport card) you can also rent bikes and scooters from train stations. You will also need to rent a lock (if you don't have one), most rental bikes no one wants, but it is Amsterdam, there is money to be made from any bike sale.</p>

        <li> <a href="http://www.discountbikerental.nl/en/">Basic discount bikes</a>By far the cheapest at 28 euro for a week!   </li> 
        <li> <a href="http://www.starbikesrental.com/rates.html/">Classic dutch bikes</a></li>
        <br>
<h4>Purchasing</h4>
<p>It's a big step in your Dutch journey. If you aren't, tall, athletic, and, dutch sized, it might be difficult for you to find a bike that fits. There are two modes of getting a bike: you either buy one off the shelf at a Hema or bike superstore 'fietswinkel', but for the authentic dutch experience, you should find the bike of your dreams on <a href="http://www.marktplaats.nl/c/fietsen-en-brommers/c445.html">Marktplaats.</a> Here google translate will be your friend. Part-adventure-part-treasure hunt, for 80 euro or less you get a slightly worse for wear but very respectable bike.</p>

<h2>Buying Things</h2>  
<p>Shopping in Amsterdam, is quite different from the large shopping complexes available overseas. Potentially because of the space in Amsterdam(or better put a lack of it) the shopping here is very segmented. You are going to have to prepare yourself to go into a few shops to get all the ingredients you might want for a particular meal, a brand of toothpaste, or a tea towel. Particularily if you are looking for something very specific. Of course there are areas like Zeedijk where you can find Asian food, or Markets for fresh food that are always a nice change from the usual stuff.</p>
<br>
<h3>Opening hours</h3>
<p>This is a bit of a strange one, most stores are open 10am to 6pm here, Tuesday* to Saturday. On Mondays many shops do a stocktake/ refill in the morning and open at noon. Large chains like AH, Jumbo, Praxis, as well as the shop in tourist areas like Dam square are open of Sunday for supplies. Cafe's are anyone's guess, you'll have to look them up. Just be prepared that things might be closed on Sunday or Monday. </p><br>  
        <center><IMG SRC="images/euro.svg" ALT="Cash or Pin?" style= "width:100%; background-color:#fffff"></center><br>
<h3>Cards and Cash</h3><br>
<p> Shannon and Hans are the people to talk to about this one, but, starting out in Amsterdam, shops that accept foriegn credit cards can be hit and miss. If you are in a touristy area like Dam Square, most likely your card will be accepted. Further out, its anyones guess, the Netherlands prefers Maestro cards, with a pin, if that helps. One grocery store that accepts foreign cards is Marqt, so a good fallback option if youa are hungry and cashless. <br><br><h3>ATM's</h3><br>The orange lion clad, ING ATM's are the most conistant in accepting foriegn cards, so keep your eye open for them when walking around.<br><br><h3>Starting an account</h3><br>  Ok, so most of us are with ABNAmro, because its close to work, and one of the most expat friendly banks available. To start an account you need something to verify your address, and an employment contract. You have to book a 'meeting' time to open an account. Dutch people love meetings.</p><br>
<h2>Shop Guide</h2>
<p>There are a lot of boutique shops, particularily on Haarlemmerstraat, the Nine streets and Neuwendijk, but for day-to-day things, here is a starter list of shops, and what they sell. </p><br>

<div class="section group">

        <div class="col span_1_of_3">

            	<center><a href="http://www.ah.nl/"><img src="images/brand_albert_heijn.svg" style= "width:160px"></a></center><br>
            <p> Albert Heijn is an institution here, its usually quite a small supermarket, scattered on street corners everywhere. Despite being dutch, they carry a selection of products, and, can differ between stores, both in layout and what they stock. Dutch people are all about discounts, so it's no suprise the Bonus card (a form of loyalty/discount card) is asked about at almost every checkout. It's free to get, most of the time all you have to do is ask.</p><br>
        
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_3">
	<center><a href="http://www.blokker.nl/"><img src="images/brand_blokker.svg" style= "width:160px"></a></center><br>
            <p> Blokker is a bit of a catch all shop for homewares, and domestic products.Any appliances you might want around the house, to washing powder, throw rugs or a creepy mug for your tea. It can all be found here, for fairly cheap. They also from time to time sell discounted rail tickets, which for 19 euros give the holder unlimited travel across the Netherlands for a day or weekend. Oh, and tacky dutch souvenirs, if you want to send some presents to friends.</p><br>
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_3">
	        <center><a href="http://www.etos.nl/"><img src="images/brand_etos.svg" style= "width:160px"></a></center><br>
            <p> Etos, is another jumble of things. Primarily a drugstore it is stocked with many things to do with health and beauty. Its not quite at a pharmacy level, so you cannot fill a script at etos. But there are some medications behind the counter that you can ask for. You can also buy lollies, perfumes, detergent and dyes here.  </p><br>   
         
	</div>
</div>
        
<div class="section group">

        <div class="col span_1_of_3">
            <center><a href="http://www.jumbosupermarkten.nl/"><img src="images/brand_jumbo.svg" style= "width:160px"></a></center><br>
            <p> Jumbo is an alternative to Albert Heijn, prices are probably about the same, but it stock a few more niche and international products. i.e american popcorn, surinamese curry powder or ginger beer. There are not too many around Amsterdam, but if you see one its worth paying a visit for some treats</p><br>
            
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_3">
	<center><a href="http://www.xenos.nl/"><img src="images/brand_xenos.svg" style= "width:160px"></a></center><br>
            <p> Xenos, hmmm, lets say you can buy pretty much and cheap-stop-gap furniture, clothes, kitchenware, food or decorations in this place. Great if you want to organize a theme party, or pimp something. Very cheap, and slightly crazy, you can find many strange things here. Even ones you didnt know that you were looking for.</p><br>
      
	</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_3">
           <center><a href="http://www.kruidvat.nl/"><img src="images/brand_kruidvat.svg" style= "width:160px"></a></center><br>
            <p> Kruidvat is a slightly cheaper version of etos, with some bulk buy discounts. It is a drugstore of sorts. It carries many more home related goods, like washing detergent and homewares.  </p><br>  
	</div>
</div>
        
        <div class="section group">

            <p> Dirk is the dutch no frills brand of supermarket. Mostly found in regional areas, or suburbia, there are still a few scattered around Amsterdam. here you will find all sorts of characters, and many of the locals. You can buy foos very cheaply here, other alternatives are ALDI and C1000, but they are not as common.</p><br>
</div>
	<div class="col span_1_of_3">
	<center><a href="http://www.hema.nl/"><img src="images/brand_hema.svg" style= "width:160px"></a></center><br>
            <p> Hema is historically known for its sausages, but has long outgrown rookworst, tompoucen, and pies. It sells simple homewares, fashion, office supplies, furniture, and ofcourse, food. A retail store simular to Target most of the items you get in Hema are cheap and well made. Well worth a visit. </p><br>

	<div class="col span_1_of_3">
           <center><a href="http://www.vd.nl/"><img src="images/brand_vd.svg" style= "width:160px"></a></center><br>
            <p> V&D is a department store. It primarily sells clothes. But, also has a lot of electronics, books, stationary, and homewares with a variety of big brands within the shop itself. V&D also has a restaurant usually attached to it called La Place, where you can buy a decent meal for under 10 euro.</p><br>

            <p> Marqt is a rare find in Amsterdam, it is one of the few supermarkets that accepts foreign bank cards freely and is entirely cashless. It sells many bio and organic foods, including pre-prepared meals. They also have a lot of products that cannot be found in Albert Heijn. If you like Marqt, you should also check out EkoPlaza. </p><br>

<h2>Finding a home</h2>  
<p> Amsterdam can be an expensive, and tricky place to find a place to live. With some persistance, a bit of luck, and some help from the people you meet, you can find a lovely place. Essentially there are 3 housing markets operating in Amsterdam (not including anti-squatting), Expat rentals, the Dutch housing market, and the Room rental scene.
  <br>  For Visa purposes you will need to be able to register at the Gemente (town hall). So make sure you can eventually registed in the place you chose. Registration will help you to get your tax number, residency, bank accounts, and health insurance via a strange fkow chart of dependencies.

    <h3>Pricing, what to expect</h3><br>A one bedroom apartment in the Amsterdam rings tends to go for <b>1200+ </b>Euro a month. A room in a house/apartment close to the center is in the range of   <b>400 to 800</b> euro. In most cases in a shared situation, kitchens and bathrooms are shared, so meeting yor housemates is a smart move.<br><br>
    <h3>Where to start Looking</h3><br>
<li><a href="http://www.funda.nl/">Funda</a>A good real-estate rental site, which is also an App. Be wary of unfurnished, here in the Netherlands that really means un-furnished. </li><br>
<li><a href="http://www.kamernet.nl/">Kamernet</a> A subscription service, free to browse, you pay to use. A good place to look for a room rental/ house sharing situation. 19 Euro a month, many new posts everyday, fairly reliable. </li><br>
<li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/amsterdam.apartments/">Facebook, Amsterdam Apartments and Rooms</a>A strange use of facebook, but hey it works, lots of new stuff daily, plus you can vet the housemates via facebook.There are a few of these groups, and its free to join, and leave, so an easy win really. </li> <br>
        <li><a href="http://amsterdam.en.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>A bit of a mixed bag, be wary of scammers, but you come across some great houses sometimes.Have a look in Sublets/temporary if you are looking for a short stay. </li><br>
        

    <i>Jo's insider tip
 If looking for a longer term house or home, try to look up the route to work, and calculate ride-time or transport time. Although we are heading towards summer (woohoo!) a ride of 20 minutes is the absolute most that the human soul can endure, on a cold, windy, rainy day. If you have a public transport fail safe, then you are the ultimate winner. So keep distance in mind, when picking a location.</i>
