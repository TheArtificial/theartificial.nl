logo-story: "As digital designers, it's  easy to forget about all of the great things that we can do with our handsâ€”sketching, painting, folding paper, etc. It's important that we always push our work on the screen by starting our process off of the screen. Staying true to this mantra, my logo is a digital representation of the hand lettering that fills my many notebooks."
quote: "Leave everything better than you found it."

I am an artist, designer, and sometimes geek who loves thinking about the various intersections of humanity, technology, and aesthetics. When I'm not designing products and experiences at The Artificial, I can be found in my studio, [telling stories though paint](http://www.shannonethomas.com).
