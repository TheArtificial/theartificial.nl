logo-story: "As digital designers, it's  easy to forget about all of the great things that we can do with our hands—sketching, painting, folding paper, etc. It's important that we always push our work on the screen by starting our process off of the screen. Staying true to this mantra, my logo is a digital representation of the hand lettering that fills my many notebooks."
quote: "Leave everything better than you found it."

I am an artist, designer, and sometimes geek who loves thinking about the various intersections of humanity, technology, and aesthetics. When I'm not designing products and experiences at The Artificial, I can be found in my studio, [telling stories though paint](http://www.shannonethomas.com).
