logo-story: "Everything has its own shape at each moment. Life generates dynamics, patterns shapes the world. Design is a constant process changing over time. Still in this process we can choose key moments that define the shape of our path."
quote: "life is about discovery and joy"

I am from Portugal and I belive that design is about people. It is about life and I love life.
I like to observe people and I allways wonder what are they thinking or why they act in certain way. In my passion for life you can find my passion for elementar shapes and strong colors.
I like to try new things and get involved in the processing of doing it. My crush is in using raw materials as a part of a digital whole.
