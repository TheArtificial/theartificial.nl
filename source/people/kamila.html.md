logo-story: "I wanted my logo to show positive energy and diversity of The Artificial’s spirit. To truly express myself in this project, I turned to the mediums I know best - pencils, brushes, and markers. I wanted to use what’s best in both worlds - freedom that my hands give me working on paper and precision I can achieve digitally. After crafting the design with markers, I translated it into curves on the screen."
quote: "Good design is built on observation, compassion, and snacks."

I am a designer with education in product, experience in graphics and interest in digital. I feel that good design is more than aesthetics and can explain the world to people, help make sense of the mess. In my free time I am also [an illustrator and letterer](https://www.instagram.com/thelastdot/).

Oh, I also want to travel everywhere that I haven’t been yet.
