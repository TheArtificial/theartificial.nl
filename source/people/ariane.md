logo-story: " Art Nouveau and Art Deco movements omnipresence in Amsterdam inspired me, especially typographies and architectures near our office location on Herengracht: the famous ‘men canals’ in which influential merchants and regents of the city lived in the XIIe century. Those peculiar movements shaped the city soul… unique city for a unique start-up."

Interaction Designer born in Paris, lived in Australia, Singapore and China.

My greatest pleasure is spending time at sea as I always had a fascination for oceans. 
I am an eternal optimist and I believe in sharpening our beings by cultivating open-mindedness and curiosity, and by working with perseverance and discernment.
Nature, Art, cultures, psychology, sciences and technology are the leitmotivs soaking up my life. I believe techniques are a perfect bridge and tool to re-unite the nature / culture dichotomy that society tend to split in two separate entities. Interaction design is an invitation to stimulate thoughts for creating previously unrealized connections. Designs ties up humans with their world in unusual ways that springs up valuable visions, habits and … future.
