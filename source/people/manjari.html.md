logo-story: "My first tryst with Industrial Design was countless hours (years) of perspective and isometric drawing which taught me two very important things about design - invest in process and donâ€™t skimp on the details. I strived to carry that with me as I ventured from designing in the third-dimensional space to one that lived primarily in pixels. While the depths (no pun intended) of my logo comes from my past, the play is influenced from the multi-cultural environment here at The Artificial, where we all come from different parts of the world but work together in harmony, pushing forward to design great experiences. "

Torn between my love for designing for the physical and digital world, I chose to explore the complex intersection of both worlds. As a recent graduate from Carnegie Mellon University, I design seamless interactive connections and experiences between people, technology, services, and spaces through service design thinking and research. Forever restless, I cook, travel, write and create random artifacts, which you can view at [The Exploratorium](http://manjarisahu.com/exploratorium/)
