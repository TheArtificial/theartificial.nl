logo-story: "The Artificial was inspired by Walter Gropius's success building the Bauhaus, which broke down the &ldquo;barrier between craftsmen and artists&rdquo; by blending design inspiration with understanding of engineering. In this spirit, I hand-coded my logo from SVG with a geometric style inspired by Herbert Bayer."
quote: "Design is how we build on purpose."

I spend my life struggling to understand everything about both people and technology. It is a privilege to live through this cybernetic era as we work together to build culture that is global, humanistic, and sustainable.

Most of my passion energy goes into building software, cycling, and [writing](http://hans.gerwitz.com/).
