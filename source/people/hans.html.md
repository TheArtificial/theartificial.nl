logo-story: "The Artificial is inspired by the Bauhaus and its success in breaking down the &ldquo; barrier between craftsmen and artists&rdquo; by blending design inspiration with engineering knowledge. In this spirit, I hand-coded my logo from SVG with the lettering style of Herbert Bayer."
quote: "Design is what we call thoughtful building."

I spend my life struggling to understand everything about both people and technology. It is a privilege to live through this cybernetic era as we work together to build a sustainable global culture.

Most of my passion energy goes into writing software, cycling, and [writing](http://hans.gerwitz.com/).
