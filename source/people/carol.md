logo-story: "My typographic logo has five pieces of the letterforms detached. The subtraction is reflective of my love for minimalistic design and demonstrates how the subtractive process can create dynamic and whimsical solutions without being ostentatious.

In the animated version, pieces fly out into a swirling colorful gradient."
quote: "I say something pithy about design, here."

I’m a graphic designer hailing from Los Angeles interested in creating memorable solutions. In a nutshell, typography, play, and experimentation define my work. 

When I’m not at The Artificial, I’m thinking up some idiosyncratic [side projects](http://www.carolliao.com) or exploring my new city. The most important thing to know about me is my deep-rooted passion for black forest cakes.
