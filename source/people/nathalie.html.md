logo-story: "I created logo with a solid font carved from building blocks while the graphs shows not just my position but also what I see in the Artificial: statistics.
This time however itâ€™s not numbers, calendar sheets, cells, or paragraphs in documents but personal data of yours truly.


Since I'm not a designer however, this logo has taught me a lot of lessons after letting me trip several times and forcing me to reexamine why.


Proud of it now, I know I will be looking back at it one day and wonder what I could have done better which will give the logo another dimension: my growth within The Artificial."

Trained to go into the world of beta science, I made a detour by working in retail and supporting or leading teams which taught me a lot about finance, and working with people. It gave me a base for being the fixer in this studio where I enter yet another world for me to explore.

In my free time I like to chase new experiences, wrestle people on the mat and play videogames old and new.
