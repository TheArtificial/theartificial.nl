Shannon loves thinking about the various intersections of humanity, technology, and aesthetics. When she’s not designing products and experiences at The Artificial, she can be found in her studio, [telling stories though paint](http://www.shannonethomas.com).

“I take ideas the world isn’t quite ready for and turn them into products people can’t imagine living without.”
